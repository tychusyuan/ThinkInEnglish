The walls of my holdfast
will not stand the winter.

The stones were last mortared
in the time of King Aerys,

are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.

When I was a boy,

156
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:45,060
I remember seeing them put up a new tower
at Torrhen's Square in a summer.

157
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,104
Men worked back then.

158
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:52,484
Today, my holdfast looks like it was built
by drunk children.

159
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,655

howling through the gaps.

161
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,910
Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.

Maintenance of a holdfast generally falls
to the lord of that holdfast.

He didn't choose it.

167
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,763
Maybe not, my lord,
but he called in his banners and took the men.

168

Do you remember your vows, ser?

171
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,396
Of course I remember!

172
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,524
We can spare four masons
for a week, my lord.

173
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,569
Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?

174
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,696
I believe it will.

175
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,622
We didn't want him here all day, did we?

176
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,501
I didn't like the way
he was talking about Robb.

177
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,252
Nor did I.

178

00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,114
Take them and cast your light upon us,

355
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,244
for the night is dark and full of terrors.

356
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,248
MEN: For the night is dark and full of terrors.

357
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,544
MELISANDRE: After the long summer,

358
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,505
darkness will fall heavy on the world.

359
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,175
The stars will bleed.

360
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,844
We need to stop her.

361
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,681
MELISANDRE: The cold breath of winter
will freeze the seas...

362
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,935
- Not now.
...and the dead shall rise in the North.

363
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,274
All you men were named
in the light of the Seven!

364
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,402
Is this how you treat the gods of your fathers?

365
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:34,073
Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?

366
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,084
You smell of fear,

367
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:49,130
fear and piss and old bones.

368
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,217
Do you want to stop me?

369
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,598
Stop me.

370
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,279
In the ancient books, it's written

371
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:17,075
that a warrior will draw
a burning sword from the fire.

372
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,412
And that sword shall be Lightbringer.

373
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,796
Stannis Baratheon,

374
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,382
Warrior of Light,

375
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,217
your sword awaits you.

376
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,490
(MEN CHEERING)

377
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,959
MEN: Lord, cast your light upon us!

378
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,839
MELISANDRE:
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

379
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,095
For the night is dark and full of terror.

380
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:50,001
This woman will lead him
into a war he cannot win.

381
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,669
Stannis is our king.

382
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:53,171
We follow where he leads,

383
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,757
- even if we don't like the path.
- King.

384
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,927
Since that boar killed his brother,
every lord wants a coronation.

385
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,180
I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.

386
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,890
As do I,

387
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:07,602
but loyal service means telling hard truths.

388
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,689
He's surrounded by fools and fanatics,

389
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,818
but he trusts you, Davos.

390
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,488
If you tell him the truth...

391
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,949
What's the truth?

392
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:38,174
MATTHOS: "And I declare upon the honor of
my house that my beloved brother Robert..."

393
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,802
He wasn't my beloved brother.

394
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,970
I didn't love him. He didn't love me.

395
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,889
A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.

396
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,015
A lie. Take it out.

397
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,104
"That my brother Robert
left no trueborn heirs,

398
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:55,775
"the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen,
and the girl Myrcella being born of incest

399
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,903
"between Cersei Lannister
and her brother Jaime Lannister.

400
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,739
- "By right of birth..."
- Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

401
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,157
Call him what he is.

402
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,662
"And her brother Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer."

403
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,040
"By right of birth and blood,
I do this day lay claim..."

404
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:14,001
STANNIS: Make it Ser Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer.

405
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,129
Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.

406
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,548
"Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

407
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,842

"I do this day lay claim
to the Iron Throne of Westeros.

409
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,681
"Let all true men declare their loyalty."

410
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,058
When Eddard Stark learned
the truth, he told only me.

411
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:31,352
I'll not make the same mistake.

412
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,438
Send copies of that letter
to every corner of the realm,

413
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,440
from the Arbor to the Wall.

414
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,692
The time has come to choose.

415
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,862
Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.

416
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,448
Your Grace, the Lannisters are
the true enemy.

417
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,616
If, for the time being,
you could make peace with your brother...

418
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,785
I'll not make peace
with Renly while he calls himself king.

419
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,662
Well, many have already declared for him,

420
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,956
Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.

421
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,251
Stannis does not need
to beg this lord or that lord for support.

422
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,836
The Lord of Light stands behind him.

423
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,173
And how many ships
has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

424
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,717
- He has no need for ships.
- DAVOS: I'm sure he doesn't,

425
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,343
but we do if we're going to war.

426
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,472
If not Renly, Your Grace,
join forces with Robb Stark.

427
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,640
Who would steal
the northern half of my kingdom.

428
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:13,144
I've always served thieves according
to their deserts, as you well know, Ser Davos.

429
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,272
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves.

430
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,774
They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.

431
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,570
I owe you an apology, my king.

432
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,364
My duty is to serve.

433
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:29,577
You have chosen the new god
over the old gods.

434
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,039
May the Lord of Light watch over us all.

435
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,458
Shall we drink together?

436
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,001
Don't.

437
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:42,089
A cup of wine to honor the one true god.

(MEN MURMURING)

The night is dark and full of terrors, old man,

441
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,809
but the fire burns them all away.

442
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,191
(CHATTER)

King in the North.

444
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,311
I keep expecting you to leave me
in one castle or another for safekeeping,

445
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,272
but you drag me along from camp to camp.

446
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,109
Have you grown fond of me, Stark?

447
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,986
Is that it?

448
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,863
I've never seen you with a girl.

449
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,450
If I left you with one of my bannermen,

450
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,536
your father would know within a fortnight

451
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:39,165
and my bannerman would receive
a raven with a message,

452
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:42,793
"Release my son
and you'll be rich beyond your dreams.

"Refuse and your house
will be destroyed, root and stem."

You don't trust the loyalty
of the men following you into battle?

Oh, I trust them with my life,

just not with yours.

You're held captive by a boy.

Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.

466
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,556
Stannis Baratheon sent ravens
to all the high lords of Westeros.

467
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,687
King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king

00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,238
How convenient for him.

00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:56,575
My father learned the truth.

473
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,285
That's why you had him executed.

474
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,621
I was your prisoner
when Ned Stark lost his head.

475
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:04,375
Your son killed him
so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him.

And you,

477
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,089
you pushed my brother from a window
because he saw you with the queen.

00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,304
You have proof?

479
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,058
Or do you want to trade gossip
like a couple of fishwives?

I'm sending one of your cousins down to
King's Landing with my peace terms.

to negotiate with you?

You don't know him very well.

No, but he's starting to know me.

Three victories don't make you a conqueror.

485
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,495

And cum and garlic and rum.

495

You can smell cum from the balcony?

496
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:43,307
I love the stink. I love the noise.

497
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,392
Cities make me want to fuck.

498
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,562

No one will know.

00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,283
You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.

They're all liars, good liars, bad liars,

506

What about you?

508
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,627
Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.

509
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,380
(LAUGHS) Truth?

510
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,343
You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.

511
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,387
Why do you think I am so little?

512
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:25,766
I'm being crushed beneath
the weight of all that truth.

513
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,982
Ned Stark actually slept on this.

514
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:36,694
As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.

515
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,116
One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.

518
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,091
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

519
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,718
Of course, Your Grace.

520
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,720
Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya,

521
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,972
we can't seem to locate her.

522
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,602
If she's escaped the capital,
Winterfell seems the logical destination.

523
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,104
And yet my friends in the North
report no sign of her.

524
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,064
Curious.

525
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,233
If we choose to negotiate with the Starks,

526
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,319
the girl has some value. Whoever finds her...

527
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,654
Well, you know what they say
about Lannisters and debts.

528
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,115
Well, you could ask Varys where she is.

529
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,451
He'll have an answer for you.

530
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,952
Whether you believe it...

531
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:31,040
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

532
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,584
Who knows what they want?

533
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,586
A mockingbird.

534
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,673
- You created your own sigil, didn't you?
- Yes.

535
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:44,428
Appropriate, for a self-made man
with so many songs to sing.

536
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,096
I'm glad you like it.

537
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,642
Some people are fortunate enough
to be born into the right family.

538
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,186
Others have to find their own way.

539
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,773
I heard a song once

540
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,442
about a boy of modest means

541
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,028
who found his way into the home
of a very prominent family.

542
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,989
He loved the eldest daughter.

543
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,408
Sadly, she had eyes for another.

544
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,747
When boys and girls live in the same home,
awkward situations can arise.

545
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:17,127
Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers
and sisters develop certain affections.

546
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,214
And when those affections
become common knowledge,

547
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:24,134
well, that is an awkward situation indeed,

548
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,345
especially in a prominent family.

549
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,722
But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

550
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,183
I've found.

551
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,269
And which truth is that?

552
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,689
Knowledge is power.

553
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,486
Seize him.

554
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,240
Cut his throat.

555
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,076
Stop. Wait.

556
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,246
I've changed my mind. Let him go.

557
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,917
Step back three paces.

558
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,129
Turn around.

559
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,339
Close your eyes.

560
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,262
Power is power.

561
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:14,685
Do see if you can take some time away
from your coins and your whores

562
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,603
to locate the Stark girl for me.

563
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,356
I would very much appreciate it.

564
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,119
ROBB: You're Ser Alton Lannister?

565
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,788
I am, Your Grace.

566
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:38,250
ROBB: I offer your cousins peace
if they meet my terms.

567
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,629
First, your family must release my sisters.

568
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,258
Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us

569
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:51,055
so he may rest beside his brother and sister
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

570
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,142
And the remains of all those who died
in his service must also be returned.

571
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,103
Their families can honor them
with proper funerals.

572
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:00,981
- An honorable request, Your Grace.
- Third...

573
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:07,321
Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce
all claim to dominion of the North.

574
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:12,659
From this time till the end of time,
we are a free and independent kingdom.

575
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,745
The King in the North.

576
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,247
- King in the North.
- King in the North.

577
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:21,043
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men
shall set foot in our lands again.

578
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,128
If he disregards this command,

579
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:26,090
he shall suffer the same fate as my father,

580
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,928
only I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.

581
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,389
These are... Your Grace, these are...

582
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,975
These are my terms.

583
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,145
If the Queen Regent and her son meet them,
I'll give them peace.

584
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,522
If not,

585
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,776
I will litter the South with Lannister dead.

586
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,570
King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.

587
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,197
Oh, is he?

588
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:54,159
You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.

589
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,454
That will be all for tonight.

590
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,429
A word, Your Grace?

591
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,976
You don't have to call me "Your Grace"
when no one's around.

592
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,687
It's not so bad once you get used to it.

593
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,730
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

594
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,900
The Lannisters are going
to reject your terms, you know?

595
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,819
Of course they are.

596
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,196
We can fight them
in the fields as long as you like,

597
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:34,575
but we won't beat them
until you take King's Landing.

598
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,621
And we can't take King's Landing
without ships.

599
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,166
My father has ships
and men who know how to sail them.

600
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,001
Men who fought my father.

601
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,336
Men who fought King Robert
to free themselves

602
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:50,090
from the yoke of the South,
just like you're doing now.

603
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,427
I'm his only living son.

604
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,556
He'll listen to me. I know he will.

605
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,769
I'm not a Stark. I know that.

606
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,273
But your father raised me
to be an honorable man.

607
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,611
We can avenge him together.

608
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,907
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

609
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,284
I need his ships. They say he has 200.

610
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:21,246
They say a million rats
live in the sewers of King's Landing.

611
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,831
Shall we rally them to fight for us?

612
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,791
I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.

613
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:28,670
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy
because he is not trustworthy.

614
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,049
Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.

615
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:35,886
Yes. And now I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.

616
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,222
Before me, it was Father.

617
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,973
You married one rebel and mothered another.

618
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,976
I mothered more than just rebels,

619
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,270
a fact you seem to have forgotten.

620
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:49,608
If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls,
my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

621
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,903
You want to leave Sansa
in the queen's hands?

622
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,988
And Arya...

623
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:59,826
I haven't heard a word about Arya.
What are we fighting for, if not for them?

624
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,455
It's more complicated than that!
You know it is.

625
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,514
It's time for me to go home.

626
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,518
I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.

627
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,813
You can't go to Winterfell.

628
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,148
I beg your pardon?

629
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:33,610
I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys

630
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:38,073
because tomorrow
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

631
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,158
Why in the name of all the gods...

632
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:44,037
Because I need you
to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.

633
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,206
He's rallied an army of 100,000.

634
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,041
You know him. You know his family.

635
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,502
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.

636
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,878
You have a hundred other lords...

637
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,965
Which of these lords
do I trust more than you?

638
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,677
If Renly sides with us,

639
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,263
we'll outnumber them two to one.

640
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,141
When they feel the jaws beginning to shut,
they'll sue for peace.

641
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,893
We'll get the girls back.

642
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,896
Then we'll all go home, for good.

643
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,282
I will ride at first light.

644
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,294
We will all be together again soon, I promise.

645
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,302
You've done so well.

646
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:44,514
Your father would be proud.

647
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,360
- Give Lord Renly my regards.
- King Renly.

648
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,155
There's a king in every corner now.

649
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,045
What is all this?

650
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,215
Returning this room to its proper appearance.

651
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,176
Say what you will about the Targaryens,
they were conquerors.

652
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,887
That is a seat for a conqueror.

653
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,557
It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.

654
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,060
We can't find Arya Stark.

655
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,145
With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

656
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,272
Perhaps. But if not, we need her.

657
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,608
They'll never give Jaime back
to us for Sansa alone.

658
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,194
I think they might. They're weak.

659
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,196
They put too much value on their women.

660
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,908
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

661
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,952
Send out as many men as we can.

662
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:48,912
I'm sure if you asked Grandfather...

663
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,748
The king does not ask, he commands.

664
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:55,627
And my grandfather's stupidity
in the field of battle

665
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,547
is the reason Robb Stark
has Uncle Jaime in the first place.

666
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,507
His life is in danger.

667
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:03,051
We're at war.

668
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:05,262
All our lives are in danger.

669
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:11,935
I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.

670
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,020
And you.

671
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:19,025
Our enemies will say anything
to weaken your claim to the throne.

672
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,986
It's not a claim. The throne is mine.

673
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,364
Of course it is.

674
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,452
No one believes this foul gossip.

675
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,537
Someone believes it.

676
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:34,124
Father had other children?

677
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,960
Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?

678
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,545
(HAMMERS CLATTERING)

679
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,922
What are you asking?

680
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:44,259
I'm asking if he fucked other women
when he grew tired of you.

681
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,678
How many bastards does he have running...

682
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,847
(WORK STOPS)

683
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:06,740
What you just did is punishable by death.

684
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,329
You will never do it again.

685
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,664
Never.

686
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,797
That will be all, Mother.

687
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,596
(SCREAMING)

688
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,640
No, no, no, no.

689
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,518
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

690
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,019
Ease into it.

691
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,105
Slowly, with passion.

692
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:42,776
Oh, yeah.

693
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,780
Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on.

694
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,366
Both of you are working tonight.

695
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,205
We do things differently here, Daisy.

696
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:59,167
This isn't some five-copper
bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

697
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:01,836
- Haystack Hall.
- Wherever you're from.

698
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:06,383
Our establishment doesn't cater
