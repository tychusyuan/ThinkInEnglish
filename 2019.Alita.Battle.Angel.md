2
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:23,709
Mm-mmm.

3
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:02,614
You're alive.

4
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:58,971
What are you dreaming,
little angel?

5
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:18,175
Well...

6
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,546
Try again.

7
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:26,815
Well, that's the best
I can do for now.

8
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:27,916
I'm really grateful, Doc.

9
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:29,851
I'll be getting some overtime
next week.

10
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:31,120
Yeah, pay me when you can.

11
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,991
Here,
I got these for you.

12
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:35,924
My wife works out
at Farm 22.

13
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:37,294
Thank you.

14
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:39,731
See you next time.

15
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,698
Keep getting paid in fruit,

16
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,668
and we'll be picking
these ourselves.

17
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:48,740
Hello, sleepyhead.

18
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:51,976
Hi.

19
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:54,680
How do you feel?

20
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,813
Okay.

21
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,685
Any pain anywhere?

22
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:01,252
No.

23
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,955
- Numbness?
- No.

24
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:06,924
Motor dysfunction?

25
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,928
I'm a little hungry.

26
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:11,894
Eat this.

27
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:13,398
Get your sugar levels up.

28
00:06:20,904 --> 00:06:23,240
Taste receptors are working.

29
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:25,907
Thank you.

30
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:29,346
You'll like this a whole lot
better with the peel off.

31
00:06:30,748 --> 00:06:32,714
I don't mean to be rude...

32
00:06:32,716 --> 00:06:34,820
but am I supposed
to know you?

33
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,818
Actually...

34
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,320
we haven't met.

35
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:41,859
I'm Dr. Dyson Ido.
This is Nurse Gerhad.

36
00:06:43,894 --> 00:06:46,197
And do you know who I am?

37
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:50,233
Well, we were hoping...

38
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,034
you'd fill in that part.

39
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,303
Since you're
a total replacement cyborg...

40
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:57,472
and most of your cyber body
was destroyed...

41
00:06:57,474 --> 00:06:59,108
we can't find any records.

42
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,782
But your very human brain
was miraculously intact.

43
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:07,649
Theoretically, you should
remember something.

44
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:10,122
Oh. Well...

45
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:13,224
It's still pretty blank.

46
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:17,762
No, it's completely blank,
actually.

47
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:23,834
I don't even
know my own name.

48
00:07:28,606 --> 00:07:30,909
Let's look at the bright side.

49
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,111
Your tears are working.

50
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:46,858
Mmm.

51
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:50,195
That's so good.

52
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:51,930
What do you call this?

53
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:20,688
Yeow! What's that?

54
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,558
- Zalem.
- Oh!

55
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,963
The last of
the great sky cities.

56
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:30,265
- What holds it up? Magic?
- No.

57
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:33,338
Something stronger.
Engineering.

58
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:42,510
And down here,
we have Iron City.

59
00:08:42,512 --> 00:08:43,978
With all its charm.

60
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,415
Dr. Dyson Ido. That's you.

61
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:50,522
While I'm learning names,
do you have one for me?

62
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:52,556
Alita.

63
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:58,262
It's a nice name.

64
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:00,531
I love it.

65
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:02,463
Can I keep it?

66
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:05,000
At least until I can
remember my real name?

67
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,637
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

68
00:09:08,073 --> 00:09:09,771
Okay.

69
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:11,473
- Do you want to take a look?
- Yes.

70
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:19,180
Why are there
so many languages?

71
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:21,449
Um, after the big war
I told you about...

72
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:22,351
The Fall.

73
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,053
After The Fall,
only Zalem was left...

74
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:28,158
and survivors came here
from all over the world.

75
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,593
Everybody down here
works for Zalem.

76
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:33,763
The Factory, the Farms...

77
00:09:33,765 --> 00:09:35,497
Does anyone ever
go up to Zalem?

78
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:36,365
We should go.

79
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,300
Nobody from down here
ever goes up.

80
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:40,037
It's a rule
that's never broken.

81
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,906
What?

82
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,778
<i>Oh!
And he takes him down hard!</i>

83
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,283
What is that?

84
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,951
It's Motorball.

85
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:55,885
That's so cool.

86
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,224
Nothing you need to be
wasting your time watching.

87
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:18,043
Alita.

88
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:20,512
One minute, please.

89
00:10:27,484 --> 00:10:28,519
Hi.

90
00:10:30,287 --> 00:10:31,355
Hello.

91
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,489
You want some?

92
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:34,559
Here you go.

93
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,564
Can I hug you?

94
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:41,065
Hi.

95
00:11:02,051 --> 00:11:03,919
<i>Step aside.</i>

96
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:06,255
<i>Out of the way.</i>

97
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:21,439
Outstanding.

98
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:26,643
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

99
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:30,678
I gotta admit...

100
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,618
I never saw anybody
challenge a Centurion before.

101
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:38,455
Whoa. You're heavy.

102
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,190
I mean...

103
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,191
Oh.

104
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:43,695
You're a cyborg.

105
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:47,732
Sorry, I was just
admiring your hand.

106
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,234
Can I see?

107
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,441
Wow.

108
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,444
It's really nice work.

109
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:03,381
Did Doc Ido do it?

110
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:05,747
He built all of me.

111
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:08,818
Except my core. That's mine.

112
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,388
Well, he did
a really great job.

113
00:12:13,992 --> 00:12:15,457
Hey, what are those things?

114
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:16,661
The Centurions?

115
00:12:17,493 --> 00:12:19,761
What planet are you from?

116
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:21,996
Ido found me
in the Scrapyard.

117
00:12:21,998 --> 00:12:23,966
- The Scrapyard?
- Mm-hmm.

118
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:25,900
But that would mean...

119
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:27,169
Hey, Doc.

120
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:29,507
I got those driver-boards
you were looking for.

121
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:32,006
Alita is new here.

122
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:33,909
She's still learning
about things.

123
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:35,044
I gotta go.

124
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,377
I'll drop those off later.

125
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:39,215
I need a rebuild
on a quad servo.

126
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,785
Maybe I'll see you around.

127
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:45,356
Who is that?

128
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,192
Hugo.

129
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,358
He's a hard worker, but...

130
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,529
Alita, come on,
let's go home.

131
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:01,439
- Hugo.
- Let's go home.

132
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:17,712
There's the damn Jackers

133
00:14:17,714 --> 00:14:20,348
that ripped me to shreds
standing right there.

134
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,218
And that <i>vale madre</i> Centurion
wouldn't lift a finger.

135
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,755
Why would anyone wanna
take your arms and legs?

136
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:27,758
Torque coupling.

137
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:32,797
Those Jackers want your parts
for the black market.

138
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,564
To supply the Motorball games.

139
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:37,298
You were lucky.

140
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,434
Another girl was murdered
last night, right near there.

141
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:43,972
Yeah, I heard that guy
carves girls up...

142
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:45,640
and sells their body parts.

143
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:51,513
Sorry, Doc.

144
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,115
For now, I don't want you
out after dark.

145
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:54,449
Is that understood?

146
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:55,586
Okay.

147
00:14:56,454 --> 00:14:57,886
And if you go out
during the day,

148
00:14:57,888 --> 00:15:00,021
don't wander too far
from this neighborhood.

149
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:01,122
Okay.

150
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:02,189
Promise?

151
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:03,560
I promise.

152
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:15,974
Hey, kid.

153
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:31,756
Hey, what's your problem?

154
00:15:45,802 --> 00:15:46,970
Who's the girl?

155
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,541
My new assistant.

156
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:55,944
I was surprised to see her
in our daughter's body.

157
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:58,649
You were supposed to have
destroyed that years ago.

158
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:03,387
- I couldn't.
- Clearly.

159
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:07,959
And did you tell her
who you built that body for?

160
00:16:11,395 --> 00:16:14,196
Our daughter is dead, Chiren.

161
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:16,030
- You need to let it go.
- Oh.

162
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:19,070
It's obviously not me that's
clinging to something here.

163
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:34,919
Over here!

164
00:16:47,363 --> 00:16:49,530
- Hugo.
- Hey, Alita.

165
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:51,033
Is this Motorball?

166
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:52,967
It's just a scrimmage.

167
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:54,339
Do you wanna join in?

168
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:57,908
Come on, every kid's
gotta play Motorball.

169
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:01,709
Sure, why not?

170
00:17:01,711 --> 00:17:03,580
I want us
to be a team again.

171
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:06,651
I have a great new setup...

172
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,351
and equipment...

173
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:11,022
worthy of your skills.

174
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:14,523
Together, we can build
the finest champions

175
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:15,993
this game has ever seen.

176
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:18,459
Could be my ticket home.

177
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:21,496
When are you going to realize
there is no way back?

178
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,130
It just does not happen.

179
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:24,299
Vector can make it happen.

180
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:26,267
I can't believe
you trust Vector.

181
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:28,605
He has very high connections.

182
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,876
I won't help you
build monsters.

183
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:42,786
I'm going to get back
to Zalem somehow.

184
00:17:43,886 --> 00:17:47,157
I'll claw my way there with
my bare hands if I have to.

185
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:08,111
Hey, everyone,
this is Alita.

186
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:11,079
Hi.

187
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:12,917
Best way to learn
is to go in.

188
00:18:28,665 --> 00:18:29,931
Pass the ball!

189
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:31,065
That's it.

190
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:32,936
Lean into your turns,
look for an opening.

191
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:36,040
I think I'm getting it!

192
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:43,847
You can let go
of the remote now.

193
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,151
Oh, crap.

194
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:56,425
- Come on, get her!
- Come on, get her!

195
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,525
Cut her off!

196
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:58,930
Koyomi, pass her the ball.

197
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:01,665
And she got it! She got it!

198
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:04,768
Get her!

199
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:11,709
Sorry, princess.

200
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:14,141
Nice, Tanji, thanks.

201
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:16,012
She's never played before.

202
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:21,686
Sorry.

203
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,096
Got this!

204
00:19:35,098 --> 00:19:36,099
Mine!

205
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:44,941
You got me!

206
00:20:01,257 --> 00:20:02,259
Good shot.

207
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:10,198
Your freak girlfriend's got
some serious malfunctions.

208
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,799
I'm really sorry.

209
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:13,601
She humiliated you
so severely.

210
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:17,605
All right,
I'll see you tonight.

211
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:20,210
And, uh,
she's not my girlfriend.

212
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:22,947
Whatever.

213
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,822
You've got some talent
for this game.

214
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,156
I've got to get home now.

215
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:36,294
Ido wants me in the house
before dark.

216
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:41,065
Do you want a ride?

217
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:48,504
So you can't
remember anything?

218
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:49,803
I'm trying to.

219
00:20:49,805 --> 00:20:52,940
Family, friends,
favorite food?

220
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:55,476
Nothing. Well, maybe oranges.

221
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:56,844
But that's just
since yesterday.

222
00:20:56,846 --> 00:20:58,746
- Oranges?
- Uh-huh.

223
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:00,785
Nope. Unacceptable.

224
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:03,688
Here, check this out.

225
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,289
Thank you very much, <i>Senora.</i>

226
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,293
And here you go.

227
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,427
Thank you.

228
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:13,896
You ready?

229
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:14,899
Try this.

230
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:16,267
Trust me.

231
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,868
It's chocolate.

232
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:24,939
Mmm.

233
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:26,978
- That is so great.
- It's good, right?

234
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:30,778
I have a favorite food now.

235
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,013
- Thank you.
- This is my favorite food.

236
00:21:32,015 --> 00:21:33,281
Well, I wouldn't
call it that.

237
00:21:33,283 --> 00:21:34,349
I would.

238
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:36,320
Hey, look. Check it out.

239
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:38,719
It's a Hunter-Warrior.

240
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:42,256
He's a bounty hunter.
Named Zapan.

241
00:21:42,258 --> 00:21:43,960
Scanning for his mark.

242
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:47,331
I wouldn't wanna be that guy.

243
00:21:48,865 --> 00:21:50,834
Look at that sword.

244
00:21:51,668 --> 00:21:53,838
All guns are outlawed
in Iron City.

245
00:21:54,504 --> 00:21:56,240
Punishable by death.

246
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:00,777
Anything that
challenges Zalem.

247
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,335
Didn't I tell you to be home
before dark?

248
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:31,805
What's the big deal?
I just lost track of time.

249
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:35,142
Yeah. Don't trust anyone.

250
00:22:35,144 --> 00:22:38,014
People do terrible things
to each other here.

251
00:22:38,782 --> 00:22:40,448
What happened to your arm?

252
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,682
Here, eat this.

253
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:42,952
You okay?

254
00:22:49,058 --> 00:22:51,461
You still need proper
nourishment for your brain.

255
00:22:54,863 --> 00:22:56,132
You have any chocolate?

256
00:23:01,238 --> 00:23:02,838
It's a harsh world.

257
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,540
The strong prey
on the weak down here.

258
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:07,745
You gotta stay focused
on your dream.

259
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,411
What's your dream?

260
00:23:10,413 --> 00:23:12,016
I'll show you.

261
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:33,770
This is my secret place.

262
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:36,172
Best view in town.

263
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,746
Wow.

264
00:23:43,313 --> 00:23:44,448
Really cool.

265
00:23:45,248 --> 00:23:46,851
No. Look.

266
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,853
That view.

267
00:23:50,153 --> 00:23:51,154
Oh.

268
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:53,056
Right.

269
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:01,030
I wonder
what it's like up there.

270
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,502
Better than this dump
down here.

271
00:24:07,703 --> 00:24:09,504
Listen.

272
00:24:12,174 --> 00:24:15,378
It's stuff from the Factory
going up to Zalem.

273
00:24:17,213 --> 00:24:20,350
But the tubes are just
for cargo, not for people.

274
00:24:21,684 --> 00:24:23,118
If I was as strong as you,

275
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,586
I'd climb that tube
to Zalem right now.

276
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:27,155
They don't let anybody
up there.

277
00:24:27,157 --> 00:24:29,624
Yeah, that's what they
want you to think.

278
00:24:29,626 --> 00:24:31,726
You just gotta know
the right people.

279
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:34,064
- I happen to be connected.
- Oh.

280
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:39,236
You gotta be willing
to do what it takes.

281
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:43,973
Whatever it takes.

282
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:49,012
Funny thing is,
you've seen it.

283
00:24:49,546 --> 00:24:51,248
You just can't remember.

284
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,184
What do you mean?

285
00:24:55,853 --> 00:24:57,555
Doc found you
in the Scrapyard.

286
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,192
All that stuff is dumped
from Zalem.

287
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:05,028
So you must be from up there.

288
00:25:10,432 --> 00:25:11,868
I guess so.

289
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:15,536
If you could just tell me
what those eyes have seen.

290
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:16,938
I wish I could.

291
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,142
I keep trying to
remember, but...

292
00:25:19,942 --> 00:25:23,078
It's still a blank.

293
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,482
I'm starting to feel
like I wasn't very important.

294
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,049
Just an insignificant girl

295
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:30,287
thrown out with
the rest of the garbage.

296
00:27:12,622 --> 00:27:14,522
- No! Stop!
- Alita!

297
00:27:14,524 --> 00:27:15,526
Don't do it!

298
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:17,460
Oh, no.

299
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:19,759
It's a trap.

300
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:23,496
Looking for me, Doctor?

301
00:27:23,498 --> 00:27:28,002
Or should I say,
Hunter-Warrior?

302
00:27:28,004 --> 00:27:29,437
"Hunter-Warrior"?

303
00:27:33,977 --> 00:27:36,009
Oh, no.

304
00:27:36,011 --> 00:27:39,048
Looks like he's got us.

305
00:27:41,051 --> 00:27:42,453
Don't move.

306
00:27:44,188 --> 00:27:46,254
Hey, thanks for
bringing a girl.

307
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:48,459
That's gonna save us
some time.

308
00:28:01,871 --> 00:28:06,009
Nice shot, for a Meat-Boy.

309
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:17,353
No!

310
00:28:18,956 --> 00:28:21,125
You came to rescue me?

311
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,661
That is so sweet.

312
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,063
You have nice eyes.

313
00:28:29,065 --> 00:28:32,268
He's mine.
You can have the girl.

314
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:36,803
So long as I get his eyes.

315
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:37,807
Alita, run!

316
00:28:55,325 --> 00:28:56,459
My God.

317
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:00,530
Rip that flea!

318
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,505
You are so beautiful.

319
00:29:09,672 --> 00:29:14,344
I wanna rip you open
and see if you're ugly inside.

320
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,581
Like the others.

321
00:29:36,732 --> 00:29:38,401
Watch her die.

322
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:24,344
Come here, little flea...

323
00:30:24,346 --> 00:30:26,749
so I can pinch
your head off.

324
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,303
Hi-yah!

325
00:30:54,044 --> 00:30:55,544
99!

326
00:30:55,546 --> 00:30:56,747
On your left!

327
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,484
Hi-yah!

328
00:31:16,098 --> 00:31:18,766
You'll pay, little flea.

329
00:31:18,768 --> 00:31:20,570
Grewishka does not forget.

330
00:31:21,237 --> 00:31:22,605
I'm coming for you.

331
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:26,643
Both.

332
00:31:35,017 --> 00:31:37,554
Grewishka does not forget!

333
00:31:40,824 --> 00:31:43,858
When I was fighting,
I remembered something.

334
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,793
I was in a huge battle.

335
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:47,394
You surprised me.

336
00:31:47,396 --> 00:31:49,298
Well,
you surprised me, too.

337
00:31:50,866 --> 00:31:52,666
Before The Fall...

338
00:31:52,668 --> 00:31:56,303
there were police
to stop criminals.

339
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:59,642
Now, the Factory pays us
to do the dirty work.

340
00:32:01,111 --> 00:32:04,348
Hunter-Warrior 17739.

341
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,915
You are a Hunter-Warrior.

342
00:32:11,254 --> 00:32:12,656
You stay here.

343
00:32:13,456 --> 00:32:14,891
Don't kill anyone.

344
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:49,292
Bounty for the cyborg Nyssiana
was 20,000 credits.

345
00:32:53,662 --> 00:32:56,197
You should've told me
who you really are.

346
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:58,165
And do you do it
for the money?

347
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,501
I take the money.

348
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:03,504
Otherwise the clinic
would've closed long ago.

349
00:33:03,506 --> 00:33:05,073
I do this work
for other reasons

350
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:06,341
I'd rather not talk about.

351
00:33:06,343 --> 00:33:08,441
You have to talk about it.

352
00:33:08,443 --> 00:33:10,646
Something during the fight
triggered a memory.

353
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,880
I was on the moon.

354
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:16,519
You know more about me
than you're saying.

355
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:19,088
Whose body is this?

356
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,792
Who am I?

357
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,903
This was your daughter?

358
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:39,475
You built this body for her?

359
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:42,976
Her name was Alita.

360
00:33:42,978 --> 00:33:45,079
She was really looking forward
to waking up

361
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:46,717
with legs that could run.

362
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,855
You built her
a pair of fast legs.

363
00:33:55,592 --> 00:33:57,794
She never got to use them.

364
00:33:58,894 --> 00:34:00,730
She was murdered.

365
00:34:02,364 --> 00:34:03,632
What happened?

366
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:07,935
A patient of mine
came to the clinic one night,

367
00:34:07,937 --> 00:34:09,439
looking for drugs.

368
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,107
<i>I was a tuner
for the Motorball games...</i>

369
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:17,447
<i>and I had made a machine body
for him of obscene strength.</i>

370
00:34:21,484 --> 00:34:24,685
<i>He was my demon,
coming back to me.</i>

371
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,957
Hey! What are you doing there?

372
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:43,573
<i>Alita couldn't get out
of the way fast enough.</i>

373
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,574
<i>Her mother, Chiren,</i>

374
00:34:47,576 --> 00:34:49,779
<i>couldn't deal with
Alita's death.</i>

375
00:34:52,582 --> 00:34:55,051
Maybe she just
couldn't deal with me.

376
00:34:58,353 --> 00:34:59,989
So I went hunting.

377
00:35:02,091 --> 00:35:03,893
<i>I needed to kill him.</i>

378
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:09,196
<i>Maybe I was just hoping
that he would kill me.</i>

379
00:35:09,198 --> 00:35:11,132
It brought no peace.

380
00:35:11,134 --> 00:35:13,234
There were other demons
like him out there...

381
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:17,641
and I felt, somehow, I was
responsible for all of them.

382
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,176
So I registered
as a Hunter-Warrior.

383
00:35:21,178 --> 00:35:23,180
There's nothing noble
about it.

384
00:35:25,314 --> 00:35:27,183
Did you ever find peace?

385
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:31,120
I found you.

386
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,623
I'm not your daughter.

387
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,196
I don't know what I am.

388
00:35:40,395 --> 00:35:42,795
I do.

389
00:35:42,797 --> 00:35:45,100
Have a look
at your original Cyber-core.

390
00:35:46,636 --> 00:35:48,603
This is your brain.

391
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,908
A normal healthy
teenage girl's brain.

392
00:35:52,642 --> 00:35:54,578
If there is such a thing.

393
00:35:56,145 --> 00:35:58,178
But this is your heart.

394
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,714
Part of your original core...

395
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:04,851
powered by
an Anti-Matter Micro-Reactor.

396
00:36:04,853 --> 00:36:07,687
So I've got a strong heart?

397
00:36:07,689 --> 00:36:08,755
You have a heart
strong enough

398
00:36:08,757 --> 00:36:11,660
to power all of Iron City
for years.

399
00:36:13,997 --> 00:36:15,730
This is lost technology.

400
00:36:15,732 --> 00:36:17,934
Nobody's made
this stuff since...

401
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:20,368
before The Fall.

402
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,205
Yeah, right.

403
00:36:23,272 --> 00:36:25,075
So I'm 300 years old?

404
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,978
Sweetheart, you are.

405
00:36:44,794 --> 00:36:47,763
I don't want my players losing
unless I tell them to.

406
00:36:48,864 --> 00:36:51,632
It can't be left to chance.

407
00:36:51,634 --> 00:36:53,567
You promised me champions.

408
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:56,437
And you promised me
the best of everything.

409
00:36:56,439 --> 00:36:58,973
Get those military servos
I asked for.

410
00:36:58,975 --> 00:37:00,911
You don't have
a winning attitude.

411
00:37:01,743 --> 00:37:04,580
Just be ready
for tomorrow's game.

412
00:37:28,605 --> 00:37:29,737
Help me.

413
00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:31,174
Grewishka?

414
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,243
Why should I waste
my talent on you?

415
00:37:35,245 --> 00:37:37,247
Look what she's done to me.

416
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:40,984
Ido's little cyber girl.

417
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,222
What did you say?

418
00:37:50,091 --> 00:37:54,795
<i>The woman in my memory
called me 99.</i>

419
00:37:54,797 --> 00:37:59,400
<i>What you saw was a flash
of your previous life.</i>

420
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,900
<i>Who was I?</i>

421
00:38:00,902 --> 00:38:02,738
<i>In time, you'll remember.</i>

422
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:49,652
I wanna rip her in half.

423
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:51,688
Grewishka.

424
00:38:53,355 --> 00:38:55,725
Oh, how the mighty
have fallen.

425
00:38:56,725 --> 00:38:58,493
Are we stripping him
for parts?

426
00:38:58,495 --> 00:38:59,962
I need you to
look at something.

427
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,033
It's a Telepresence Chip.
He's wired.

428
00:39:06,035 --> 00:39:08,402
Somebody in Zalem
is riding him.

429
00:39:08,404 --> 00:39:11,638
There are watchers behind
the eyes all over the city.

430
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,806
Pretty common now.

431
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,411
I'd just as soon remove it...

432
00:39:15,011 --> 00:39:16,444
while I'm rebuilding him.

433
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:17,643
Why are you wasting time

434
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:19,714
on this burnt-out
street junk?

435
00:39:19,716 --> 00:39:21,114
It's a personal matter.

436
00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:23,919
Do you like your job, Vector?

437
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:26,654
If you like your position

438
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,821
and the many comforts
that come with it...

439
00:39:28,823 --> 00:39:32,961
I strongly suggest
you listen to Dr. Chiren.

440
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,065
Nova.

441
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:38,767
My apologies.

442
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,203
Who did this to Grewishka?

443
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:43,940
A little cyborg girl.

444
00:39:44,774 --> 00:39:45,906
Though the impact points

445
00:39:45,908 --> 00:39:47,810
are evidence
of extraordinary power...

446
00:39:49,544 --> 00:39:51,178
I don't understand
how she could create

447
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,813
such force
with such a small body.

448
00:39:53,815 --> 00:39:57,417
It was not the power
of the body that did this.

449
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:58,518
It was the mind.

450
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,890
She knows the fighting
techniques of Panzer Kunst.

451
00:40:02,892 --> 00:40:04,790
Rebuild Grewishka.

452
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:06,995
Have him bring her to me.

453
00:40:07,462 --> 00:40:08,464
Dead.

454
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,241
He's gone.

455
00:40:19,575 --> 00:40:21,310
Not gone.

456
00:40:22,444 --> 00:40:23,979
Repatched.

457
00:40:25,647 --> 00:40:27,850
You're a clever woman, Doctor.

458
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:32,521
And determined to reach
your goal at any cost.

459
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,924
So I'll make you this offer.

460
00:40:37,926 --> 00:40:40,861
If and when
you have pleased me...

461
00:40:40,863 --> 00:40:43,767
I will grant you
the destiny you seek.

462
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:45,468
Zalem.

463
00:40:47,335 --> 00:40:48,902
You'll send me to Zalem?

464
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,907
I'm there right now.

465
00:40:52,473 --> 00:40:55,077
Consider my services engaged.

466
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:17,129
There is no bounty
on Grewishka.

467
00:41:17,131 --> 00:41:19,900
But you reported it
to the Factory.

468
00:41:19,902 --> 00:41:21,634
Him killing
all of those women...

469
00:41:21,636 --> 00:41:23,203
Somebody's protecting him.

470
00:41:23,205 --> 00:41:25,174
Who has the power to do that?

471
00:41:27,477 --> 00:41:29,879
Someone far beyond us here.

472
00:41:31,814 --> 00:41:34,216
We better stay off
the street for now.

473
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:37,886
I wanna be
a Hunter-Warrior like you.

474
00:41:38,687 --> 00:41:40,388
Alita, that's impossible.

475
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,855
We could be a team.

476
00:41:41,857 --> 00:41:43,690
Alita, this is dangerous,
dirty work.

477
00:41:43,692 --> 00:41:45,493
- I know.
- No, you don't.

478
00:41:45,495 --> 00:41:47,029
How is that
your choice to make?

479
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:48,895
It's out of the question.

480
00:41:48,897 --> 00:41:50,763
I might need
a life-or-death situation

481
00:41:50,765 --> 00:41:52,065
to remember who I was.

482
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:54,201
Even if it's just
for a second.

483
00:41:54,203 --> 00:41:56,370
Alita, some things are
better left forgotten.

484
00:41:56,372 --> 00:41:59,306
I don't want blood
on these hands, too.

485
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,210
Then I'll find out
for myself.

486
00:42:01,643 --> 00:42:03,178
Alita.

487
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,583
I'm just tired of it.

488
00:42:09,585 --> 00:42:12,319
He just wants me
to be his perfect little girl.

489
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:15,388
So, you gonna live
by his rules or yours?

490
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,556
<i>What a battle!</i>

491
00:42:16,558 --> 00:42:19,792
<i>These two have been going
at each other all match.</i>

492
00:42:19,794 --> 00:42:21,529
Welcome to Motorball.

493
00:42:27,937 --> 00:42:30,506
<i>Jashugan has got the ball.</i>

494
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:33,942
<i>Claymore attacks!</i>

495
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,980
<i>Jashugan takes him out!</i>

496
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,125
<i>Masakus sends Jashugan flying!</i>

497
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:55,131
<i>Kutty now with the ball,
one point.</i>

498
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,167
<i>Zariki is in hot pursuit.</i>

499
00:43:05,808 --> 00:43:08,645
- <i>Wipeout, Zariki!</i>
- Whoo!

500
00:43:13,114 --> 00:43:16,051
<i>And he throws Kutty
like a rag doll!</i>

501
00:43:24,826 --> 00:43:27,363
Come on.
Let me show you something.

502
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:33,000
I know all the pit crews
and tuners.

503
00:43:33,002 --> 00:43:34,270
I'll introduce you around.

504
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:37,974
Who's the top player?

505
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,574
Right now, I'd say Jashugan

506
00:43:41,576 --> 00:43:43,743
has the best chance
of making Final Champion.

507
00:43:43,745 --> 00:43:46,145
Camber's still off
in the left bogie.

508
00:43:46,147 --> 00:43:48,949
I was oversteering
in turn six.

509
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:50,484
What's Final Champion?

510
00:43:50,486 --> 00:43:53,219
It's the best thing
a Motorball player can win.

511
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:56,156
Every few years, they choose a
player that can't be beaten...

512
00:43:56,158 --> 00:43:57,891
and he gets to go to Zalem.

513
00:43:57,893 --> 00:43:59,460
Hey, Hugo.

514
00:43:59,462 --> 00:44:02,462
Slow is smooth,
smooth is fast.

515
00:44:02,464 --> 00:44:03,964
Do it once, do it right.

516
00:44:03,966 --> 00:44:06,169
Juggernaut needs to pit,
right now.

517
00:44:06,768 --> 00:44:08,201
Do you like to lose?

518
00:44:08,203 --> 00:44:10,138
Then get him in here.

519
00:44:11,973 --> 00:44:15,044
Claymore is a rebuild.
Why is he not tracking?

520
00:44:17,812 --> 00:44:19,379
Alita's here.

521
00:44:19,381 --> 00:44:20,980
That's Vector.

522
00:44:20,982 --> 00:44:22,882
He basically runs Motorball.

523
00:44:22,884 --> 00:44:24,951
We do a lot of business
with his team.

524
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,752
Selling parts to him
and his new tuner.

525
00:44:26,754 --> 00:44:27,920
Chiren.

526
00:44:27,922 --> 00:44:29,390
Let's go, guys. Come on,
get me back out there.

527
00:44:29,392 --> 00:44:31,727
What? You're not the only one
with connections.

528
00:44:32,995 --> 00:44:35,565
<i>Kutty closing in
on Juggernaut.</i>

529
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,768
<i>Kinuba has Kutty
in his sights.</i>

530
00:44:52,247 --> 00:44:53,913
<i>Oh! Kinuba went through him</i>

531
00:44:53,915 --> 00:44:56,817
<i>like laundry
with those Grindcutters.</i>

532
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,755
<i>Is that weapon even legal?</i>

533
00:45:02,924 --> 00:45:04,857
Kinuba's too strong
with that new weapon.

534
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:06,762
He's screwing up the odds.

535
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,395
You know...

536
00:45:09,397 --> 00:45:11,767
I could really use
his Grindcutters...

537
00:45:12,768 --> 00:45:14,337
for our other project.

538
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,705
<i>Crimson Wind making
her way through the field.</i>

539
00:45:19,707 --> 00:45:20,742
So, what do you think?

540
00:45:24,413 --> 00:45:25,615
I like it.

541
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,748
Yo, Hugo. We gotta go.

542
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,384
Hey, something's come up.

543
00:45:31,386 --> 00:45:33,687
- Where are you going?
- I just gotta do something.

544
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,290
Can you get back okay?

545
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,560
Yeah, sure.

546
00:45:38,593 --> 00:45:40,627
Can you go out tomorrow?

547
00:45:40,629 --> 00:45:42,228
I wanna show you this place
me and Tanji know.

548
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,998
It's out in the Badlands.

549
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,501
It might help
with your memory.

550
00:45:46,602 --> 00:45:47,770
I'd appreciate that.

551
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:50,002
Thanks.

552
00:45:50,004 --> 00:45:51,440
For everything.

553
00:45:53,408 --> 00:45:56,411
<i>Wow!
He is throwing down!</i>

554
00:45:58,946 --> 00:46:01,183
Whoo!

555
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:08,724
Oh, shit!

556
00:46:09,857 --> 00:46:11,160
- What the hell?
- Shit.

557
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,279
Hurry up!

558
00:46:34,616 --> 00:46:35,618
You're dead!

559
00:46:38,553 --> 00:46:39,920
You little runts!

560
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,557
I'm gonna smash your skulls!

561
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,865
You can't do this to me!

562
00:46:51,033 --> 00:46:52,602
- Ready.
- Give me.

563
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,768
Careful.

564
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:56,636
You street punks!

565
00:46:56,638 --> 00:46:58,707
I'm gonna
make you pay for this.

566
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:23,799
Nice work.

567
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:26,636
Compliments to your crew.

568
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,638
Thank you, sir.

569
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,475
I'll pass it on.

570
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,944
Hey, man, where's my cut?

571
00:47:36,946 --> 00:47:38,111
Hey, when you gonna tell
your hardbody

572
00:47:38,113 --> 00:47:39,446
you jack cyborgs, huh?

573
00:47:39,448 --> 00:47:40,846
I'm not.

574
00:47:40,848 --> 00:47:42,181
And neither are you.

575
00:47:42,183 --> 00:47:44,620
You afraid
she's gonna cut you loose?

576
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,261
Get the Grindcutters
over to Chiren right away.

577
00:47:55,263 --> 00:47:56,731
Use the service gate.

578
00:47:57,866 --> 00:47:58,868
Go.

579
00:48:13,314 --> 00:48:15,214
Vector, you prick.

580
00:48:15,216 --> 00:48:16,683
I should've known.

581
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,754
What you should've known,
my friend...

582
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:21,357
is that no one...

583
00:48:23,225 --> 00:48:25,328
is greater than the game.

584
00:48:46,114 --> 00:48:48,114
What's outside the city?

585
00:48:48,116 --> 00:48:49,248
Not much.

586
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,817
The war
wiped out all utilities

587
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:52,287
and most everything else.

588
00:48:55,924 --> 00:49:00,393
All we know is the sky cities
fell all in one night...

589
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,562
when the enemy launched
the last attack

590
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,000
with every ship they had.

591
00:49:05,033 --> 00:49:06,501
Who was the enemy?

592
00:49:07,169 --> 00:49:09,036
The URM.

593
00:49:09,038 --> 00:49:12,875
United Republics of Mars.
The U-R-M.

594
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:14,440
URM.

595
00:49:14,442 --> 00:49:17,044
On that last night
of the war...

596
00:49:17,046 --> 00:49:19,712
the earth shook
and the sky burned.

597
00:49:19,714 --> 00:49:22,884
But in the morning,
Zalem still stood.

598
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:24,853
It's just up ahead.

599
00:49:32,694 --> 00:49:35,429
This ship is from
the battle of Zalem.

600
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:36,596
I figured that
maybe seeing stuff

601
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,401
from the war would
help trigger your...

602
00:49:46,741 --> 00:49:48,241
Salvagers have jacked
some stuff

603
00:49:48,243 --> 00:49:49,612
over the years for metal...

604
00:49:50,245 --> 00:49:51,545
but it's all URM technology,

605
00:49:51,547 --> 00:49:52,846
so it's mostly been
left alone.

606
00:49:52,848 --> 00:49:55,281
- This is an URM ship?
- Uh-huh.

607
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,583
You know, it's pretty hard
to sell this stuff

608
00:49:56,585 --> 00:49:58,551
since no one knows
what it is...

609
00:49:58,553 --> 00:49:59,654
Shh!

610
00:50:08,163 --> 00:50:09,765
We have to go
to the command deck.

611
00:50:11,901 --> 00:50:13,368
It's forward.

612
00:50:14,134 --> 00:50:15,768
How does she know that?

613
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:18,641
Hey, we can't get there.
It's underwater.

614
00:50:51,538 --> 00:50:53,843
How long do you think
she can hold her breath?

615
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:56,145
I don't know.

616
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,919
Oh, this can't be good.

617
00:53:08,843 --> 00:53:09,844
Forget it.

618
00:53:10,578 --> 00:53:11,881
I won't do it.

619
00:53:12,279 --> 00:53:13,281
But...

620
00:53:14,082 --> 00:53:16,449
But you have to.

621
00:53:16,451 --> 00:53:17,917
This would help us
fight Grewishka

622
00:53:17,919 --> 00:53:20,055
and anyone else
he sends after us.

623
00:53:22,022 --> 00:53:23,024
This body...

624
00:53:24,091 --> 00:53:26,658
it has the power I need.

625
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,763
I feel a connection to it
I can't explain.

626
00:53:29,765 --> 00:53:31,596
This could be who I am.

627
00:53:31,598 --> 00:53:34,033
You've been given
a chance to start over,

628
00:53:34,035 --> 00:53:35,167
with a clean slate.

629
00:53:35,169 --> 00:53:36,502
How many of us get that?

630
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,907
Why did an enemy warship...

631
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,044
respond to me?

632
00:53:42,676 --> 00:53:44,113
Because I knew that ship.

633
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,182
I've been on others like it,
haven't I?

634
00:53:48,584 --> 00:53:50,083
Haven't I?

635
00:53:50,085 --> 00:53:53,252
Ouf, whatever you were,
it's not who you are now.

636
00:53:53,254 --> 00:53:54,757
No!

637
00:53:56,825 --> 00:53:58,826
I'm a warrior, aren't I?

638
00:54:00,261 --> 00:54:01,763
And you know.

639
00:54:02,297 --> 00:54:04,199
You've always known.

640
00:54:09,703 --> 00:54:11,172
This is called a Berserker.

641
00:54:13,207 --> 00:54:17,145
It's a humanoid weapon-system
created by the URM Technarchy.

642
00:54:18,113 --> 00:54:19,212
Your core

643
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,951
was designed to interface
with this type of body.

644
00:54:23,085 --> 00:54:26,185
Your identity code
activated it.

645
00:54:26,187 --> 00:54:28,790
The instinctive
fighting technique you use...

646
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:35,428
is Panzer Kunst,
a lost combat art for machine bodies.

647
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:37,964
It was used
by the Berserkers.

648
00:54:37,966 --> 00:54:41,967
This is why you're drawn to
conflict without hesitation.

649
00:54:41,969 --> 00:54:43,870
It's part of your training.

650
00:54:43,872 --> 00:54:47,076
You are not just
a warrior, Alita.

651
00:54:48,877 --> 00:54:50,909
You're an URM Berserker,

652
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:54,882
the most advanced
cyborg weapon ever created.

653
00:54:55,549 --> 00:54:56,982
And that is exactly why

654
00:54:56,984 --> 00:55:00,189
I will never unite you
with this body.

655
00:55:04,292 --> 00:55:05,661
That's fine.

656
00:55:07,328 --> 00:55:08,663
Fine.

657
00:55:36,757 --> 00:55:38,824
State your business.

658
00:55:38,826 --> 00:55:41,296
I'm here to register
as a Hunter-Warrior.

659
00:55:48,002 --> 00:55:49,705
How'd it go?

660
00:55:54,475 --> 00:55:56,308
You're a Hunter-Warrior,
all right.

661
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:57,743
Doc's gonna be pissed.

662
00:55:57,745 --> 00:55:59,414
Whose rules do I live by?

663
00:56:07,522 --> 00:56:09,254
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you sure about this?

664
00:56:09,256 --> 00:56:10,957
This place is just for
bounty hunters, nobody else...

665
00:56:10,959 --> 00:56:12,591
What do you think this is?

666
00:56:12,593 --> 00:56:15,361
Besides, Ido says
I'm drawn to conflict.

667
00:56:17,698 --> 00:56:20,400
Oh. I remember you.

668
00:56:20,402 --> 00:56:22,734
How's it going, little guy?

669
00:56:22,736 --> 00:56:24,772
Good?

670
00:56:26,408 --> 00:56:27,409
Just watch my back.

671
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:30,411
Oh, boy.

672
00:56:47,763 --> 00:56:50,165
Hey, Zapan!
Not the furniture.

673
00:57:00,142 --> 00:57:02,143
What brings you
in here, sweets?

674
00:57:03,178 --> 00:57:05,178
Come to see the Hunters
up close?

675
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,448
Not exactly.

676
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,492
Cupcake here is
a bounty hunter.

677
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,926
What?

678
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,259
So, you went down,

679
00:57:21,261 --> 00:57:23,763
you filled out
your application forms...

680
00:57:23,765 --> 00:57:25,230
you got your ID badge...

681
00:57:25,232 --> 00:57:27,502
and now you're just
like us, yeah?

682
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:29,969
Let me introduce you

683
00:57:29,971 --> 00:57:31,473
to some of your
professional colleagues.

684
00:57:33,174 --> 00:57:36,442
This is Master Clive Lee
of the White Hot Palm.

685
00:57:36,444 --> 00:57:38,881
He has over
200 confirmed kills.

686
00:57:39,714 --> 00:57:41,547
207.

687
00:57:41,549 --> 00:57:43,248
Well, and this is Screwhead,

688
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:46,087
one of our most lethal
bounty hunters.

689
00:57:47,455 --> 00:57:49,621
And then, there's McTeague...

690
00:57:49,623 --> 00:57:52,658
the Dogmaster,
with his Hellhounds.

691
00:57:54,129 --> 00:57:55,661
His biggest problem is having
enough left to identify after,

692
00:57:55,663 --> 00:57:58,431
so he can collect the bounty.

693
00:58:02,036 --> 00:58:03,906
And then, there's me.

694
00:58:04,605 --> 00:58:06,406
Zapan.

695
00:58:06,408 --> 00:58:09,478
Keeper of the legendary
Damascus Blade.

696
00:58:11,212 --> 00:58:16,348
Honed to a monomolecular edge.
It slices armor like butter.

697
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:19,752
Forged before The Fall by the
lost arts of URM metallurgy.

698
00:58:19,754 --> 00:58:21,924
And who did you kill
to acquire it?

699
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:30,299
A Hunter-Warrior
is a solitary predator.

700
00:58:31,332 --> 00:58:34,400
You'll be competing against us
for the kill.

701
00:58:34,402 --> 00:58:36,371
You can see
what you're up against.

702
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:42,110
Thanks.

703
00:58:45,046 --> 00:58:47,846
I came to ask
for your help...

704
00:58:47,848 --> 00:58:51,750
against our common enemy,
Grewishka.

705
00:58:51,752 --> 00:58:53,786
He's being protected
by the system,

706
00:58:53,788 --> 00:58:56,525
and continues
to rampage unchecked.

707
00:58:57,292 --> 00:58:59,460
And now,
he's after Ido and me.

708
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,728
So I'm calling on you...

709
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:05,167
my Hunter-Warrior brothers.

710
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,933
Let's band together

711
00:59:07,935 --> 00:59:10,872
and defeat him
once and for all.

712
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,582
Any takers? Hmm?

713
00:59:21,817 --> 00:59:23,218
No?

714
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,086
Big surprise.

715
00:59:26,486 --> 00:59:29,590
You know, normally,
I wouldn't take a rookie under my wing...

716
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:32,125
share my knowledge.

717
00:59:32,127 --> 00:59:34,861
I'm willing to make
an exception in your case...

718
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:36,629
if you'll cut loose
Meat-Boy over here

719
00:59:36,631 --> 00:59:37,931
and let me buy you a drink.

720
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:39,568
Hey, watch it.

721
00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:44,504
And what could I learn
from a loudmouth pretty boy...

722
00:59:44,506 --> 00:59:46,571
who spends all of his money
on his face?

723
00:59:52,247 --> 00:59:54,946
Maybe I'll pull
your arms and legs off,

724
00:59:54,948 --> 00:59:57,417
roll your head around
in the street.

725
00:59:57,419 --> 00:59:59,652
Maybe that'll teach you
some manners.

726
01:00:00,955 --> 01:00:02,788
You might mess up your hair.

727
01:00:06,194 --> 01:00:07,462
You gonna take that, Zapan?

728
01:00:08,629 --> 01:00:10,998
He's scared
of the pretty girl.

729
01:00:11,765 --> 01:00:13,299
Aah!

730
01:00:35,823 --> 01:00:38,092
You do not deserve
such a weapon.

731
01:00:40,495 --> 01:00:43,464
I heard you were
the heroes of Iron City.

732
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,866
I am not impressed.

733
01:00:46,868 --> 01:00:48,534
What the hell are you doing?

734
01:00:48,536 --> 01:00:50,538
I'm gonna need you
to stand way back.

735
01:00:53,507 --> 01:00:56,210
I will take on anyone
in this room.

736
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:59,178
And if I win...

737
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,183
you fight alongside me.

738
01:01:03,817 --> 01:01:05,353
This bitch broke my nose.

739
01:01:05,752 --> 01:01:07,221
Yes, I did.

740
01:01:09,357 --> 01:01:10,522
Heroes?

741
01:01:10,524 --> 01:01:13,125
All I see are junkyard punks,
assorted cyber-trash...

742
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:15,694
and a bunch of drunken
Motorball burnouts

743
01:01:15,696 --> 01:01:17,465
too slow to play the game.

744
01:01:59,408 --> 01:02:00,542
Thanks, Hugo.

745
01:02:12,053 --> 01:02:13,255
Oh, no.

746
01:02:26,866 --> 01:02:28,069
Hold it!

747
01:02:29,805 --> 01:02:31,937
Knock it off!

748
01:02:31,939 --> 01:02:33,808
Or no more free repairs!

749
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,819
I'm with her.

750
01:02:46,821 --> 01:02:48,589
Sorry about this.

751
01:02:51,192 --> 01:02:53,259
You and I are going
to have a little talk.

752
01:02:53,261 --> 01:02:54,960
No, we had our talk.

753
01:02:54,962 --> 01:02:57,029
You didn't leave me
another choice.

754
01:03:15,951 --> 01:03:17,152
Don't move.

755
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,328
It's Grewishka.

756
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:31,533
What's happened to him?

757
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:35,337
Well, to answer
your question...

758
01:03:40,975 --> 01:03:43,245
I've had a little upgrade.

759
01:03:52,786 --> 01:03:54,455
I'm only here for the girl.

760
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:58,225
Ah, she's all yours.

761
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:04,295
What about the rest of you?

762
01:04:04,297 --> 01:04:06,031
There ain't no bounty
on this guy, Doc.

763
01:04:07,768 --> 01:04:08,904
Not our problem.

764
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,176
It's all right, Ido.

765
01:04:22,683 --> 01:04:23,951
Aw.

766
01:04:24,785 --> 01:04:26,720
The only one with courage.

767
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:31,089
So innocent.

768
01:04:37,732 --> 01:04:42,536
Iron City is no place
for innocents, little flea.

769
01:04:52,379 --> 01:04:56,283
<i>I do not stand by
in the presence of evil.</i>

770
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:03,658
I do not stand by
in the presence of evil.

771
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,978
Come to my world.

772
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,315
Come, little flea.

773
01:05:29,116 --> 01:05:31,018
Alita! No!

774
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,828
Welcome to
the underworld. My world.

775
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:47,165
From here, there are worlds
above worlds above worlds...

776
01:05:47,167 --> 01:05:49,935
going farther up
than you can imagine.

777
01:05:49,937 --> 01:05:53,337
And the trash of each one
flows down to the one below...

778
01:05:53,339 --> 01:05:55,977
'til it all ends up here.

779
01:05:57,111 --> 01:05:59,344
It's where I used to live.

780
01:05:59,346 --> 01:06:01,649
And it's where
you're going to die.

781
01:06:32,013 --> 01:06:33,681
Dance, little flea.

782
01:07:16,357 --> 01:07:18,625
I was forgotten here to rot.

783
01:07:19,192 --> 01:07:20,594
But I was saved...

784
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,127
remade...

785
01:07:22,129 --> 01:07:25,567
by the same hand that
shapes your destiny even now.

786
01:07:27,234 --> 01:07:28,366
Whose hand?

787
01:07:28,368 --> 01:07:31,437
My master, Nova.

788
01:07:31,439 --> 01:07:33,074
What do you know about me?

789
01:08:03,471 --> 01:08:06,371
<i>You have the soul
of a survivor.</i>

790
01:08:08,676 --> 01:08:10,779
<i>You'll never give up.</i>

791
01:08:14,214 --> 01:08:15,279
Aah.

792
01:08:15,281 --> 01:08:16,785
Know what is hidden.

793
01:08:17,818 --> 01:08:19,450
Always ask...

794
01:08:19,452 --> 01:08:22,523
what is it that
you are not seeing?

795
01:08:23,456 --> 01:08:25,423
Nova?

796
01:08:25,425 --> 01:08:28,595
He is the dragon
that must be slain.

797
01:08:30,363 --> 01:08:31,565
Again.

798
01:08:32,433 --> 01:08:34,932
Look at you.

799
01:08:34,934 --> 01:08:36,804
Where are you going?

800
01:08:45,612 --> 01:08:47,480
What's the matter?

801
01:08:47,482 --> 01:08:49,414
My little toy doesn't
want to play anymore?

802
01:08:50,783 --> 01:08:53,084
I'll turn you
into a living pendant

803
01:08:53,086 --> 01:08:55,119
to adorn my chest.

804
01:08:55,121 --> 01:08:58,524
Then I can hear your voice
every moment of the day...

805
01:08:58,526 --> 01:09:00,795
pleading for mercy!

806
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:15,742
Hi-yah!

807
01:09:20,982 --> 01:09:22,515
Fuck your mercy.

808
01:09:31,192 --> 01:09:32,727
No!

809
01:09:57,852 --> 01:09:59,551
Break off!

810
01:10:03,456 --> 01:10:07,094
He wasn't a dog lover.
I hate that.

811
01:10:09,563 --> 01:10:11,265
Oh, come on.

812
01:10:16,203 --> 01:10:18,005
I'm sorry.

813
01:10:19,139 --> 01:10:20,708
I'm so sorry.

814
01:10:29,916 --> 01:10:33,151
You think you can replace us
that easily?

815
01:10:33,153 --> 01:10:35,956
Bring her back
as many times as you like.

816
01:11:11,791 --> 01:11:14,127
No one will dare
harm you again.

817
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:32,880
It's the adaptive technology
of the Berserker body.

818
01:11:35,248 --> 01:11:36,848
The shell is reconfiguring

819
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:39,252
to her subconscious image
of herself.

820
01:11:41,688 --> 01:11:44,289
I've never seen
anything like it.

821
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:48,228
It's making micro-adjustments
throughout every system.

822
01:11:52,966 --> 01:11:55,268
Looks like she's a little
older than you thought.

823
01:12:16,255 --> 01:12:18,225
Well, look at you.

824
01:12:40,313 --> 01:12:42,580
Well, you were right.

825
01:12:42,582 --> 01:12:45,085
A warrior's spirit needs
a warrior's body.

826
01:12:55,862 --> 01:12:59,198
It draws in air,
generating an arc plasma...

827
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,633
but how you control it,
I don't know.

828
01:13:01,635 --> 01:13:04,535
Didn't exactly
come with a manual, did you?

829
01:13:04,537 --> 01:13:06,174
It's some kind of weapon.

830
01:13:14,381 --> 01:13:16,149
Now you know who you are.

831
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,428
But that's just a shell.

832
01:13:28,729 --> 01:13:31,065
It's not bad or good.

833
01:13:32,299 --> 01:13:33,901
That part's up to you.

834
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:46,913
Check these out.

835
01:13:48,248 --> 01:13:49,250
Pretty fresh, right?

836
01:13:55,456 --> 01:13:56,457
Alita!

837
01:14:00,193 --> 01:14:01,195
Wow.

838
01:14:02,362 --> 01:14:04,062
You're...

839
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:06,464
- Back together?
- Very back together.

840
01:14:09,536 --> 01:14:11,005
You look...

841
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:12,704
different.

842
01:14:12,706 --> 01:14:14,106
It's all nanotech.

843
01:14:14,108 --> 01:14:16,208
It's a bunch of stuff even
Ido hasn't figured out yet.

844
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:18,410
So are you stronger
than you were?

845
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:20,148
Yeah. And faster, too.

846
01:14:21,215 --> 01:14:22,416
It feels...

847
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:24,785
more me.

848
01:14:28,788 --> 01:14:29,954
You know,
some guys might be

849
01:14:29,956 --> 01:14:31,390
intimidated by
a girl like you.

850
01:14:31,392 --> 01:14:32,557
Really? Why is that?

851
01:14:32,559 --> 01:14:34,058
'Cause you could
rip my arm off

852
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:35,392
and beat me
with the wet end.

853
01:14:36,996 --> 01:14:39,866
Well, then,
don't piss me off.

854
01:14:40,901 --> 01:14:43,368
Why don't you like her?

855
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:46,471
I just never got
the whole hardbody thing.

856
01:14:46,473 --> 01:14:48,039
And besides, she's URM.

857
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:50,609
It means she was probably
the enemy at one point.

858
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:54,311
Yeah, 300 years ago.

859
01:14:54,313 --> 01:14:55,482
Get over it.

860
01:14:58,352 --> 01:15:01,119
I'm a lot more
touch sensitive, too.

861
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:03,590
A lot higher density
of force feedback and...

862
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:06,426
texture sensors.

863
01:15:08,428 --> 01:15:10,198
You wanna try it?

864
01:15:18,304 --> 01:15:19,306
You can feel this?

865
01:15:20,006 --> 01:15:21,007
Yes.

866
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:27,281
Close your eyes.

867
01:15:28,014 --> 01:15:29,916
Close your eyes.

868
01:15:36,556 --> 01:15:38,225
How about this?

869
01:15:38,692 --> 01:15:39,993
Yes.

870
01:15:44,797 --> 01:15:46,233
Where am I now?

871
01:15:47,768 --> 01:15:49,170
You're...

872
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:52,540
with me.

873
01:16:11,524 --> 01:16:13,527
Does it bother you...

874
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,628
that I'm not completely human?

875
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:21,501
You are the most human person
I have ever met.

876
01:16:37,318 --> 01:16:39,651
He won't even let me
fix his eye.

877
01:16:39,653 --> 01:16:41,122
He says he wants the pain.

878
01:16:47,493 --> 01:16:48,496
Enough.

879
01:16:54,501 --> 01:16:55,703
Nova.

880
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:02,610
You have failed me.

881
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:06,647
Stand.

882
01:17:10,384 --> 01:17:14,652
You will never triumph until
you understand what she is.

883
01:17:14,654 --> 01:17:16,454
She's the last of her kind.

884
01:17:16,456 --> 01:17:19,160
The finest weapon
of the URM Technarchy.

885
01:17:20,294 --> 01:17:23,262
I need you to destroy
this Alita.

886
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,333
I need you to bring me
her heart.

887
01:17:28,001 --> 01:17:29,736
I live only for her death.

888
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:40,214
I hate
when he does that.

889
01:17:44,218 --> 01:17:46,453
This is not a man
who tolerates failure.

890
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:51,588
I'm not trusting my future
to a piece of iron.

891
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:53,493
What do you have in mind?

892
01:18:03,002 --> 01:18:04,304
To dreams.

893
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,908
I like your drive, Hugo.

894
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:12,313
You have a solid future
with my team.

895
01:18:13,813 --> 01:18:15,615
My future's in Zalem.

896
01:18:16,382 --> 01:18:18,318
I remember your promise
every day.

897
01:18:19,553 --> 01:18:20,621
To send me up.

898
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:23,424
When I get you
a million credits.

899
01:18:24,058 --> 01:18:25,493
Personally...

900
01:18:26,492 --> 01:18:29,729
I'd rather rule in hell
than serve in heaven.

901
01:18:32,599 --> 01:18:34,900
We'd be at the bottom
of the food chain up there,

902
01:18:34,902 --> 01:18:36,370
but down here...

903
01:18:37,571 --> 01:18:39,607
we can live like kings.

904
01:18:42,475 --> 01:18:44,107
So...

905
01:18:44,109 --> 01:18:46,447
Tell me about
this friend of yours.

906
01:18:47,546 --> 01:18:48,879
Alita?

907
01:18:48,881 --> 01:18:50,382
Is that her name?

908
01:18:50,384 --> 01:18:52,353
Alita. Hmm.

909
01:19:07,734 --> 01:19:08,736
Hi.

910
01:19:09,903 --> 01:19:11,138
Hi.

911
01:19:16,242 --> 01:19:18,243
What happened to you?

912
01:19:18,245 --> 01:19:20,613
I wound up hanging out
with Vector.

913
01:19:21,848 --> 01:19:23,617
Some alcohol was involved.

914
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,153
Apparently.

915
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,520
So, Vector?

916
01:19:28,522 --> 01:19:30,791
Is that your connection
for getting into Zalem?

917
01:19:31,925 --> 01:19:33,127
Yeah.

918
01:19:33,493 --> 01:19:34,495
Oh.

919
01:19:35,428 --> 01:19:37,531
I was hoping maybe
you'd wanna stay.

920
01:19:38,331 --> 01:19:41,435
Hey, it's not right away.

921
01:19:42,435 --> 01:19:44,703
I still gotta raise
the rest of the money first.

922
01:19:44,705 --> 01:19:45,773
It's okay.

923
01:19:47,206 --> 01:19:49,074
It's your dream.

924
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:51,645
I know it's what
you've always wanted.

925
01:19:54,814 --> 01:19:55,815
You know...

926
01:19:57,884 --> 01:19:59,319
I was always so sure.

927
01:20:02,255 --> 01:20:03,690
Now you come along...

928
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:07,394
nothing's clear anymore.

929
01:20:23,376 --> 01:20:25,578
How much more do you need
before you can go?

930
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,315
90k.

931
01:20:29,815 --> 01:20:30,850
90k?

932
01:20:31,919 --> 01:20:33,384
I can make that in bounties.

933
01:20:33,386 --> 01:20:34,485
I'll just figure out who has

934
01:20:34,487 --> 01:20:35,753
the highest prices
on their heads...

935
01:20:35,755 --> 01:20:36,722
and then I'll take them out.

936
01:20:36,724 --> 01:20:38,690
No, I can't ask you
to do that for me.

937
01:20:38,692 --> 01:20:41,395
I'd do whatever
I had to for you.

938
01:20:42,461 --> 01:20:44,228
I'd give you whatever I have.

939
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,498
What are you doing?

940
01:20:48,268 --> 01:20:50,171
I'd give you my heart.

941
01:20:51,438 --> 01:20:53,271
Take it.

942
01:20:53,273 --> 01:20:55,440
It's got an URM Micro-Reactor
for a power supply,

943
01:20:55,442 --> 01:20:57,174
probably worth millions.

944
01:20:57,176 --> 01:20:58,877
With your connections,
you can find a buyer...

945
01:20:58,879 --> 01:21:01,245
you could make enough for
both of us to go to Zalem...

946
01:21:01,247 --> 01:21:02,746
and then we just find
a cheap replacement...

947
01:21:02,748 --> 01:21:03,817
No.

948
01:21:05,085 --> 01:21:07,955
Come on, you buy
and sell parts all day long.

949
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:12,393
Don't just do things
for people.

950
01:21:13,794 --> 01:21:15,494
No matter how good
you think they are,

951
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:17,398
or how deserving they are.

952
01:21:18,364 --> 01:21:20,267
It's all or nothing with me.

953
01:21:22,202 --> 01:21:23,737
This is who I am.

954
01:21:25,037 --> 01:21:26,239
I know.

955
01:21:28,942 --> 01:21:29,944
It's okay.

956
01:21:31,044 --> 01:21:32,513
Put it back.

957
01:21:45,425 --> 01:21:46,961
That was pretty intense, huh?

958
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:51,963
Yeah, that was very intense.

959
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:55,269
Sorry.

960
01:21:56,937 --> 01:21:59,270
Maybe there's another way.

961
01:21:59,272 --> 01:22:02,207
Vector wants you to try out
for Second League.

962
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:03,542
What?

963
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:05,776
You become
a big Motorball star,

964
01:22:05,778 --> 01:22:07,478
make a pile of money...

965
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,446
we can go to Zalem together.

966
01:22:09,448 --> 01:22:10,749
What are you talking about?

967
01:22:10,751 --> 01:22:13,020
I can't be
a pro Motorball player.

968
01:22:13,953 --> 01:22:15,022
Ali...

969
01:22:16,188 --> 01:22:17,590
you could be a champion.

970
01:22:18,825 --> 01:22:19,990
You win this tryout...

971
01:22:19,992 --> 01:22:22,595
every scout will be killing
each other to get to you.

972
01:22:24,732 --> 01:22:25,765
We'll be home free.

973
01:22:26,366 --> 01:22:28,269
Only if you'll be my coach.

974
01:22:29,301 --> 01:22:30,368
Well, if that's what it takes.

975
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:32,473
That's what it takes.

976
01:22:39,513 --> 01:22:41,678
Are you going to kill her?

977
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:42,683
No.

978
01:22:43,148 --> 01:22:44,718
Much worse.

979
01:22:58,732 --> 01:23:00,466
Ido, can a human love
a cyborg?

980
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:03,534
Why?

981
01:23:03,536 --> 01:23:05,739
Does this cyborg
love a human?

982
01:23:10,108 --> 01:23:11,511
Mm-hmm.

983
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:15,445
A human can love a cyborg...

984
01:23:15,447 --> 01:23:17,084
but you have to keep your mind
on the game, Alita.

985
01:23:18,585 --> 01:23:20,752
It can get very rough
out there.

986
01:23:20,754 --> 01:23:22,689
Even for a tryout.

987
01:23:23,855 --> 01:23:24,925
Try these.

988
01:23:27,059 --> 01:23:28,795
Did you make these for me?

989
01:23:29,696 --> 01:23:30,863
Yes.

990
01:23:32,366 --> 01:23:35,502
They won't make you
any faster. It's regulation.

991
01:23:36,636 --> 01:23:38,639
But at least
they won't fail you.

992
01:23:43,076 --> 01:23:44,578
Here's our deal.

993
01:23:45,912 --> 01:23:48,112
You go in there, you race,

994
01:23:48,114 --> 01:23:49,880
you win,
you come back right here.

995
01:23:49,882 --> 01:23:54,985
You wear all of these pads,
especially this one.

996
01:23:56,456 --> 01:23:58,188
I don't need all this crap.

997
01:23:58,190 --> 01:23:59,693
Yes, you do.

998
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:02,227
Remember...

999
01:24:02,229 --> 01:24:04,561
if you wreck this body,
I can't fix it.

1000
01:24:04,563 --> 01:24:07,464
- This is URM technology.
- Yes, I know.

1001
01:24:07,466 --> 01:24:08,799
Now, go find
a place to watch,

1002
01:24:08,801 --> 01:24:10,136
because you're
making me nervous.

1003
01:24:13,239 --> 01:24:14,841
Good luck.

1004
01:24:15,642 --> 01:24:16,844
Bye.

1005
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:36,227
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

1006
01:24:36,229 --> 01:24:40,298
You are the scum of the game.

1007
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:43,601
But tonight,
you are handpicked scum.

1008
01:24:43,603 --> 01:24:45,771
Because tonight is not a game.

1009
01:24:45,773 --> 01:24:47,638
It is a hunt.

1010
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,973
I'm paying 500,000...

1011
01:24:49,975 --> 01:24:55,581
to the one who kills
the girl called Alita.

1012
01:25:01,321 --> 01:25:02,419
Hey.

1013
01:25:02,421 --> 01:25:04,455
Where are you?
The tryout's about to start.

1014
01:25:04,457 --> 01:25:05,923
I'm on my way.

1015
01:25:05,925 --> 01:25:08,160
There's something
I've gotta do first.

1016
01:25:08,162 --> 01:25:09,526
I'm doing this for us,
remember?

1017
01:25:09,528 --> 01:25:10,861
You can't miss it.

1018
01:25:10,863 --> 01:25:12,665
I won't. Trust me.

1019
01:25:16,603 --> 01:25:19,337
Please, just stop.

1020
01:25:19,339 --> 01:25:20,637
I didn't do anything to you.

1021
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:23,509
It's just business.
Nothing personal.

1022
01:25:26,078 --> 01:25:27,113
Tanji, stop!

1023
01:25:29,549 --> 01:25:30,818
Using my name?

1024
01:25:32,352 --> 01:25:33,921
Man, what's wrong with you?

1025
01:25:35,487 --> 01:25:37,821
I can't do this anymore.

1026
01:25:37,823 --> 01:25:40,024
What's the matter? You're
already gone half the time.

1027
01:25:40,026 --> 01:25:42,360
Now you show up
with this line of crap!

1028
01:25:42,362 --> 01:25:44,562
It's the little hardbody,
isn't it?

1029
01:25:44,564 --> 01:25:47,765
Listen, it's over.
Do you understand?

1030
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:48,967
I'm out.

1031
01:25:48,969 --> 01:25:52,005
And if you had any brains,
you'd leave this behind, too.

1032
01:25:53,473 --> 01:25:54,975
I'm out.

1033
01:25:56,009 --> 01:25:57,176
For good.

1034
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:01,579
You should've jacked that
bitch when you had the chance.

1035
01:26:01,581 --> 01:26:03,684
Would've been on your way
to Zalem right now.

1036
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:20,731
Well, very professional.

1037
01:26:20,733 --> 01:26:22,232
Hey, man,
we don't want any trouble.

1038
01:26:22,234 --> 01:26:25,535
If this is your mark,
we're sorry. He's all yours.

1039
01:26:27,806 --> 01:26:29,009
Hugo.

1040
01:26:29,943 --> 01:26:31,743
Jacking cyborgs.

1041
01:26:31,745 --> 01:26:32,977
Your little girlfriend
might take that

1042
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:35,182
kind of personally,
don't you think?

1043
01:26:35,448 --> 01:26:37,015
Hmm?

1044
01:26:37,017 --> 01:26:39,116
But you know girls.

1045
01:26:39,118 --> 01:26:41,787
She'll probably get all weepy
and forgive you...

1046
01:26:43,288 --> 01:26:45,123
when I show her your head.

1047
01:26:45,125 --> 01:26:46,660
There's no marker out on me.

1048
01:26:53,399 --> 01:26:55,467
There will be.

1049
01:26:55,469 --> 01:26:57,638
Murder pulls
a tight little bounty...

1050
01:26:58,904 --> 01:27:01,105
even with gutter trash
like you.

1051
01:27:01,107 --> 01:27:03,010
I never killed anyone.

1052
01:27:08,648 --> 01:27:10,283
You just did.

1053
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:19,289
She thinks
she can punk me, huh?

1054
01:27:23,563 --> 01:27:24,963
Hugo, run!

1055
01:28:30,596 --> 01:28:33,597
<i>Next up is
Second League tryouts.</i>

1056
01:28:33,599 --> 01:28:36,803
<i>Will the Factory practice team
report to the line?</i>

1057
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:46,777
<i>The winner tonight will
make it one step closer...</i>

1058
01:28:46,779 --> 01:28:49,847
<i>to qualifying
for the Champions League.</i>

1059
01:28:49,849 --> 01:28:52,750
<i>Well, that is
one tough lineup.</i>

1060
01:28:52,752 --> 01:28:54,987
<i>This is gonna be
one heck of a match tonight.</i>

1061
01:29:03,395 --> 01:29:05,032
That's no Factory team.

1062
01:29:06,032 --> 01:29:07,563
What?

1063
01:29:07,565 --> 01:29:09,767
These two punks in the back...

1064
01:29:09,769 --> 01:29:11,905
there are bounty markers
on them.

1065
01:29:13,738 --> 01:29:17,143
And the other guys,
they are Hunter-Warriors.

1066
01:29:25,919 --> 01:29:30,021
<i>And here comes
tonight's one new prospect.</i>

1067
01:29:30,023 --> 01:29:34,795
<i>Okay, then, folks,
give it up for Alita!</i>

1068
01:29:36,395 --> 01:29:38,562
Hugo brought her right to us.

1069
01:29:38,564 --> 01:29:41,067
- What'd you promise him?
- Hmm.

1070
01:29:42,635 --> 01:29:45,071
I'm sending him to Zalem,
of course.

1071
01:29:55,148 --> 01:29:57,384
Alita! Alita!

1072
01:30:01,621 --> 01:30:02,919
Hey.

1073
01:30:02,921 --> 01:30:04,253
<i>Since there is
only one new prospect...</i>

1074
01:30:04,255 --> 01:30:06,824
- What's up?
- <i>...there will be no teams.</i>

1075
01:30:06,826 --> 01:30:10,263
<i>The name of the game
is Cut-throat.</i>

1076
01:30:14,968 --> 01:30:17,002
Go easy on me, guys.

1077
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:19,469
Sure, kid.

1078
01:30:19,471 --> 01:30:21,073
No worries.

1079
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:26,744
- <i>Alita!</i>
- What are you doing?

1080
01:30:26,746 --> 01:30:28,745
It's a setup.
You gotta get outta there.

1081
01:30:28,747 --> 01:30:30,483
<i>They're gonna kill you!</i>

1082
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:35,453
Which ones?

1083
01:30:35,455 --> 01:30:36,857
All of them!

1084
01:30:39,925 --> 01:30:42,995
<i>Players, 10-second warning.</i>

1085
01:30:49,301 --> 01:30:50,536
<i>Five seconds...</i>

1086
01:31:09,354 --> 01:31:10,687
<i>The new kid, Alita,</i>

1087
01:31:10,689 --> 01:31:13,292
<i>takes possession
right off the snap.</i>

1088
01:31:22,068 --> 01:31:26,506
<i>A slow Tuesday night just
got hotter than the playoffs.</i>

1089
01:31:36,916 --> 01:31:39,350
<i>Looks like the fans
have themselves</i>

1090
01:31:39,352 --> 01:31:40,584
<i>an underdog darling...</i>

1091
01:31:40,586 --> 01:31:44,958
<i>with the face of an angel
and a body built for battle.</i>

1092
01:31:52,564 --> 01:31:53,931
<i>Maybe a little Motorball</i>

1093
01:31:53,933 --> 01:31:55,700
<i>will break out
in the middle of this fight.</i>

1094
01:31:55,702 --> 01:31:57,537
Oh, crap.

1095
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:09,780
<i>Oh! Looks like it's</i>

1096
01:32:09,782 --> 01:32:11,885
<i>"No rules Tuesday"
out there, folks.</i>

1097
01:32:23,962 --> 01:32:26,433
<i>Ouch!
You know that hurts!</i>

1098
01:32:30,537 --> 01:32:34,307
<i>Stinger's got Alita
in a lot of trouble.</i>

1099
01:32:46,019 --> 01:32:48,652
<i>She must've said something
in the locker room</i>

1100
01:32:48,654 --> 01:32:50,890
<i>that these guys did not like.</i>

1101
01:33:10,277 --> 01:33:12,743
<i>Number 99...</i>

1102
01:33:12,745 --> 01:33:14,480
<i>Alita!</i>

1103
01:33:19,785 --> 01:33:21,453
Ali, it's me.

1104
01:33:22,153 --> 01:33:23,619
<i>I've got a big problem.</i>

1105
01:33:23,621 --> 01:33:26,289
Hugo, this is not a good time.

1106
01:33:26,291 --> 01:33:27,928
<i>He's trying to kill me.</i>

1107
01:33:28,528 --> 01:33:29,860
Who's trying to kill you?

1108
01:33:29,862 --> 01:33:32,064
Zapan, the Hunter-Warrior.

1109
01:33:32,765 --> 01:33:34,334
He killed Tanji.

1110
01:33:34,899 --> 01:33:36,366
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1111
01:33:36,368 --> 01:33:38,470
<i>Now, he's coming for me.</i>

1112
01:33:42,841 --> 01:33:44,609
<i>Not sure our Battle Angel</i>

1113
01:33:44,611 --> 01:33:46,179
<i>can get out of this one.</i>

1114
01:33:47,479 --> 01:33:49,515
Oh, shit. Here he comes!

1115
01:33:51,417 --> 01:33:52,316
Where are you?

1116
01:33:52,318 --> 01:33:54,220
<i>I'm headed
to the old church.</i>

1117
01:33:55,354 --> 01:33:57,256
Okay. I'm coming.

1118
01:34:04,996 --> 01:34:07,397
<i>I can't believe it!
Incredible!</i>

1119
01:34:07,399 --> 01:34:10,103
<i>I've never seen
anything like this.</i>

1120
01:35:10,795 --> 01:35:13,030
Hey, I'm almost there.

1121
01:35:13,032 --> 01:35:14,300
Got it.

1122
01:36:16,828 --> 01:36:18,197
Where are you going, huh?

1123
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:50,462
Looks like your Hugo hasn't
been entirely honest with you.

1124
01:36:52,864 --> 01:36:54,567
Is it true?

1125
01:36:54,867 --> 01:36:55,902
Ali...

1126
01:36:57,202 --> 01:36:58,604
you don't understand.

1127
01:37:03,809 --> 01:37:05,612
I never killed anyone.

1128
01:37:06,711 --> 01:37:08,714
We only jacked parts.

1129
01:37:10,183 --> 01:37:12,886
We paralyzed them
and stripped them, that's all.

1130
01:37:15,453 --> 01:37:17,523
I needed the money for Zalem.

1131
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:21,728
Step aside
and let me do my job.

1132
01:37:25,063 --> 01:37:27,597
Touch him again
and I will kill you.

1133
01:37:27,599 --> 01:37:28,565
Interference between

1134
01:37:28,567 --> 01:37:30,601
a licensed Hunter-Warrior
and his kill...

1135
01:37:30,603 --> 01:37:33,838
is a violation of Factory Law
and the Hunter's Code.

1136
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,708
He's mine!

1137
01:37:37,242 --> 01:37:39,344
Then make the kill.

1138
01:37:46,818 --> 01:37:48,787
Come on, Hunter-Warrior.

1139
01:37:50,322 --> 01:37:52,522
Tonight, you become
one of us.

1140
01:37:58,997 --> 01:38:00,396
Mm-mmm.

1141
01:38:00,398 --> 01:38:02,432
You know, there's no room
for love or mercy

1142
01:38:02,434 --> 01:38:03,835
in the Hunter's Code.

1143
01:38:12,443 --> 01:38:14,947
Let me make it easier for you.

1144
01:38:22,587 --> 01:38:23,622
Hugo!

1145
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:32,396
<i>Deliver the criminal
Hugo, Bounty 9107.</i>

1146
01:38:32,398 --> 01:38:35,464
<i>Wanted for the crime
of murder.</i>

1147
01:38:35,466 --> 01:38:38,134
You better finish him
before we do!

1148
01:38:38,136 --> 01:38:40,505
It's Hunter Law!

1149
01:38:47,846 --> 01:38:49,279
I have to get you to Ido.

1150
01:38:49,281 --> 01:38:51,714
No. Centurions.

1151
01:38:51,716 --> 01:38:54,084
If you go back out there
with me alive,

1152
01:38:54,086 --> 01:38:55,787
they'll kill us both.

1153
01:38:59,325 --> 01:39:02,495
What did you do?
What did you do?

1154
01:39:04,929 --> 01:39:06,665
I didn't kill that guy.

1155
01:39:08,867 --> 01:39:10,435
But what does it matter?

1156
01:39:12,772 --> 01:39:14,373
I tore people apart.

1157
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:18,377
People like you, for money.

1158
01:39:20,879 --> 01:39:23,179
Where were you tonight?

1159
01:39:23,181 --> 01:39:25,448
I went to go
stop the others.

1160
01:39:25,450 --> 01:39:27,854
- And tell them I quit.
- Why?

1161
01:39:29,188 --> 01:39:31,120
Because I love you.

1162
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:36,962
God, I'm sorry.

1163
01:39:52,377 --> 01:39:53,612
<i>Did you find them?</i>

1164
01:39:54,979 --> 01:39:56,315
No.

1165
01:39:57,015 --> 01:39:58,651
They're gone.

1166
01:40:02,822 --> 01:40:06,392
You're so cold.
Please don't die.

1167
01:40:07,693 --> 01:40:09,328
Please don't.

1168
01:40:17,769 --> 01:40:20,672
I'd give him my life
if I could.

1169
01:40:34,187 --> 01:40:35,854
Maybe you can.

1170
01:40:41,527 --> 01:40:44,227
You have violated Factory Law
and the Hunter's Code

1171
01:40:44,229 --> 01:40:45,798
by protecting a wanted felon.

1172
01:40:47,565 --> 01:40:52,037
<i>Where is the criminal
Hugo, Bounty 9107?</i>

1173
01:40:57,309 --> 01:40:58,544
Hugo is dead.

1174
01:40:59,044 --> 01:41:00,576
I claim the bounty.

1175
01:41:00,578 --> 01:41:03,116
Hunter-Warrior 26651.

1176
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:06,753
<i>Claim confirmed.</i>

1177
01:41:13,326 --> 01:41:14,527
Ah.

1178
01:41:17,429 --> 01:41:19,362
Yeah, that's a cute trick.

1179
01:41:19,364 --> 01:41:21,800
You think this is
gonna work, huh? Hmm?

1180
01:41:23,068 --> 01:41:25,401
Give me that.

1181
01:41:25,403 --> 01:41:27,102
<i>Violation.</i>

1182
01:41:27,104 --> 01:41:29,172
<i>Hunter-Warrior Zapan...</i>

1183
01:41:29,174 --> 01:41:30,908
<i>stealing another's bounty</i>

1184
01:41:30,910 --> 01:41:33,843
<i>is against Factory Law
and the Hunter's Code.</i>

1185
01:41:33,845 --> 01:41:35,013
Thanks.

1186
01:41:38,951 --> 01:41:40,118
My face.

1187
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,654
My... My face!

1188
01:41:43,921 --> 01:41:45,356
My face!

1189
01:41:45,358 --> 01:41:46,826
No!

1190
01:42:01,806 --> 01:42:02,841
How is he?

1191
01:42:10,381 --> 01:42:13,752
This city corrupts
even good people.

1192
01:42:19,492 --> 01:42:20,927
He's good.

1193
01:42:21,326 --> 01:42:22,528
He's stable.

1194
01:42:29,968 --> 01:42:32,839
Chiren's surgical technique
was brilliant.

1195
01:42:35,174 --> 01:42:37,210
There's no brain damage.

1196
01:42:44,315 --> 01:42:46,850
Vector was running a scam.

1197
01:42:46,852 --> 01:42:49,052
If you're born on the ground,
you stay on the ground...

1198
01:42:49,054 --> 01:42:51,120
and no amount of money
can change that.

1199
01:42:51,122 --> 01:42:54,223
The only one way to get from
the lower world to Zalem...

1200
01:42:54,225 --> 01:42:56,259
is to become Final Champion.

1201
01:42:56,261 --> 01:42:58,928
You can't buy
your way up there.

1202
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:01,032
But how do you know that
for sure?

1203
01:43:05,069 --> 01:43:06,205
I was born there.

1204
01:43:08,806 --> 01:43:12,511
I've removed it myself,
the Mark of Zalem.

1205
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:15,945
With our daughter's illness,

1206
01:43:15,947 --> 01:43:19,649
Chiren and I were forced
to descend here to Iron City.

1207
01:43:19,651 --> 01:43:22,685
And the man responsible
for our exile...

1208
01:43:22,687 --> 01:43:25,187
the watcher
behind the eyes...

1209
01:43:25,189 --> 01:43:26,192
is Nova.

1210
01:43:28,693 --> 01:43:30,996
You had her heart
in your hands...

1211
01:43:32,730 --> 01:43:35,001
and you let her live.

1212
01:43:36,434 --> 01:43:38,203
- I did.
- Why?

1213
01:43:40,372 --> 01:43:42,207
Because I'm a doctor.

1214
01:43:43,108 --> 01:43:44,110
And...

1215
01:43:46,144 --> 01:43:47,979
I'm a mother.

1216
01:43:49,447 --> 01:43:51,816
And somehow I forgot that.

1217
01:43:54,553 --> 01:43:56,756
I can't do this anymore.

1218
01:43:58,956 --> 01:44:00,125
I'm out.

1219
01:44:03,261 --> 01:44:04,796
Chiren, wait.

1220
01:44:16,007 --> 01:44:17,910
Don't you think
it's time you went to Zalem?

1221
01:44:20,645 --> 01:44:23,579
I could send you
up there right now.

1222
01:44:23,581 --> 01:44:25,884
What I want...

1223
01:44:27,419 --> 01:44:29,622
it isn't up there.

1224
01:44:48,072 --> 01:44:50,906
I have to do something.

1225
01:44:50,908 --> 01:44:53,112
I'll come back for you.

1226
01:44:55,613 --> 01:44:57,649
This is my fault.

1227
01:45:00,551 --> 01:45:02,151
This is my fault.

1228
01:45:02,153 --> 01:45:04,790
Don't ever feel sorry
for yourself.

1229
01:45:06,023 --> 01:45:08,361
You're the only one
built for this.

1230
01:45:10,162 --> 01:45:12,198
Thank you, Father.

1231
01:45:30,916 --> 01:45:32,351
Vector!

1232
01:45:33,919 --> 01:45:35,918
<i>Hostile intention detected.</i>

1233
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:37,856
<i>Surrender your weapon.</i>

1234
01:45:46,465 --> 01:45:48,300
<i>Surrender your weapon.</i>

1235
01:46:07,385 --> 01:46:08,920
Security report.

1236
01:46:12,256 --> 01:46:13,759
Violation! Violation!

1237
01:46:14,326 --> 01:46:15,861
Violation! Violation!

1238
01:46:20,265 --> 01:46:21,800
Did you get her?

1239
01:46:22,233 --> 01:46:23,469
Security?

1240
01:46:31,077 --> 01:46:35,081
You were never going to send
Hugo to Zalem, were you?

1241
01:46:37,448 --> 01:46:39,315
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1242
01:46:39,317 --> 01:46:41,854
I always keep my promise
to send people up.

1243
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:47,727
Like Dr. Chiren here.

1244
01:46:49,827 --> 01:46:53,396
Nova demands body parts
for his experiments.

1245
01:46:53,398 --> 01:46:56,301
Especially, the brains
of people he admires.

1246
01:47:00,205 --> 01:47:04,406
And that is the only way
anyone ever gets to Zalem.

1247
01:47:10,381 --> 01:47:11,850
It took you long enough.

1248
01:47:15,287 --> 01:47:17,387
I knew you wouldn't wait
for your fate

1249
01:47:17,389 --> 01:47:18,989
to find you, little flea.

1250
01:47:18,991 --> 01:47:21,359
Get up.

1251
01:47:32,571 --> 01:47:34,140
Defense Ring!

1252
01:48:01,934 --> 01:48:03,335
Finish the mission.

1253
01:48:03,836 --> 01:48:06,372
Destroy Zalem.

1254
01:48:11,608 --> 01:48:14,813
<i>Destroy Zalem.</i>

1255
01:48:28,093 --> 01:48:30,062
I know who my enemy is.

1256
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:33,331
And I know
he's watching us now.

1257
01:48:35,701 --> 01:48:37,236
And you're just his slave.

1258
01:48:46,176 --> 01:48:49,113
And I'm just
an insignificant girl.

1259
01:49:15,739 --> 01:49:16,873
Speak.

1260
01:49:16,875 --> 01:49:19,308
No. No. No. Wait.

1261
01:49:19,310 --> 01:49:20,377
Speak!

1262
01:49:20,379 --> 01:49:22,244
What do you want me to say?
I will say anything.

1263
01:49:22,246 --> 01:49:23,812
Not you.

1264
01:49:23,814 --> 01:49:25,017
Him!

1265
01:49:34,326 --> 01:49:36,194
So we finally meet, Alita.

1266
01:49:37,095 --> 01:49:39,262
Not your real name, of course.

1267
01:49:39,264 --> 01:49:40,332
Nova?

1268
01:49:53,711 --> 01:49:54,913
Where are you?

1269
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:58,313
Home. As we speak.

1270
01:49:58,315 --> 01:50:00,051
Feet up.

1271
01:50:01,053 --> 01:50:02,218
Well, my girl,

1272
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:05,187
you've certainly exceeded
my expectations.

1273
01:50:05,189 --> 01:50:07,990
Killing my champion Grewishka.

1274
01:50:07,992 --> 01:50:09,327
Most impressive.

1275
01:50:10,229 --> 01:50:13,995
And turning a selfish creature
like Chiren.

1276
01:50:13,997 --> 01:50:16,298
I didn't see that coming.

1277
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:20,405
So, when you walk out of here,
the Factory won't stop you.

1278
01:50:21,839 --> 01:50:23,272
This time.

1279
01:50:23,274 --> 01:50:26,075
I don't need
your permission to live.

1280
01:50:26,077 --> 01:50:27,679
Others might.

1281
01:50:28,612 --> 01:50:30,381
Your Dr. Ido, for example.

1282
01:50:31,382 --> 01:50:33,018
And what about Hugo?

1283
01:50:33,986 --> 01:50:35,520
He's still alive, isn't he?

1284
01:50:36,153 --> 01:50:37,954
We will track him down.

1285
01:50:37,956 --> 01:50:39,155
Hmm.

1286
01:50:39,157 --> 01:50:42,027
I've found the only way
to enjoy immortality...

1287
01:50:42,794 --> 01:50:44,662
is to watch others die.

1288
01:50:46,663 --> 01:50:48,399
You just lost a puppet.

1289
01:50:51,937 --> 01:50:54,707
Well, that looks fatal.

1290
01:50:55,674 --> 01:50:56,742
No matter.

1291
01:50:57,776 --> 01:50:59,745
Vector was getting tiresome.

1292
01:51:03,014 --> 01:51:06,151
You've made the biggest
mistake of your life.

1293
01:51:06,984 --> 01:51:08,519
And what's that?

1294
01:51:09,621 --> 01:51:11,489
Underestimating who I am.

1295
01:51:12,924 --> 01:51:15,094
Then until next time.

1296
01:51:16,528 --> 01:51:17,529
Remember.

1297
01:51:21,666 --> 01:51:24,036
I see everything.

1298
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,839
<i>Alita.</i>

1299
01:51:30,841 --> 01:51:32,909
Factory enforcers came
looking for Hugo.

1300
01:51:32,911 --> 01:51:35,078
<i>Somehow they knew
he'd been kept alive.</i>

1301
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:37,813
<i>I helped him escape,
but they've sealed the city.</i>

1302
01:51:37,815 --> 01:51:40,051
- <i>They're going to find him.</i>
- Where is he?

1303
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:42,121
He's trying to go up.

1304
01:52:02,907 --> 01:52:04,175
Hugo!

1305
01:52:04,876 --> 01:52:06,145
Hugo!

1306
01:52:06,911 --> 01:52:08,113
Hugo.

1307
01:52:08,813 --> 01:52:10,347
Hugo!

1308
01:52:10,349 --> 01:52:11,347
Stop.

1309
01:52:11,349 --> 01:52:13,316
You have to come down.
We can't stay up here.

1310
01:52:13,318 --> 01:52:16,253
There's a bounty on me.
This is the only way.

1311
01:52:16,255 --> 01:52:18,954
No, this is dangerous.
We have to get down, now.

1312
01:52:18,956 --> 01:52:20,589
If I go back down there,
I'm dead.

1313
01:52:20,591 --> 01:52:22,792
No. You have to
listen to me, okay?

1314
01:52:22,794 --> 01:52:24,393
I've been right here before.

1315
01:52:24,395 --> 01:52:26,862
This is exactly
where Nova wants you.

1316
01:52:26,864 --> 01:52:29,065
He's using you to get to me.

1317
01:52:29,067 --> 01:52:30,767
Come on,
we have to go back down.

1318
01:52:30,769 --> 01:52:32,571
We belong up there, Alita.

1319
01:52:34,005 --> 01:52:37,309
We don't belong anywhere
except together.

1320
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:43,282
You'll always be running.

1321
01:52:45,416 --> 01:52:46,517
Together.

1322
01:52:47,986 --> 01:52:49,388
Come with me.

1323
01:52:50,888 --> 01:52:52,256
Please.

1324
01:52:55,059 --> 01:52:56,761
<i>We could be free.</i>

1325
01:53:07,639 --> 01:53:09,004
Okay.

1326
01:53:13,044 --> 01:53:14,246
No!

1327
01:53:20,986 --> 01:53:22,587
No!

1328
01:53:36,434 --> 01:53:37,569
Hold on.

1329
01:53:38,435 --> 01:53:39,604
I got you.

1330
01:53:43,174 --> 01:53:45,477
Okay, okay. Don't move.

1331
01:53:47,112 --> 01:53:49,078
Don't move.

1332
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:51,216
I'm gonna lift you up slowly.

1333
01:54:08,532 --> 01:54:09,901
Thank you...

1334
01:54:11,202 --> 01:54:13,102
for saving me.

1335
01:54:13,104 --> 01:54:14,473
I love you.

1336
01:54:15,139 --> 01:54:16,340
No!

1337
01:54:24,549 --> 01:54:25,551
No!

1338
01:54:52,577 --> 01:54:54,576
<i>It took her
only a few months...</i>

1339
01:54:54,578 --> 01:54:57,646
<i>to rise through the ranks
of the Second League.</i>

1340
01:54:57,648 --> 01:55:00,917
<i>And tonight,
she makes her first appearance</i>

1341
01:55:00,919 --> 01:55:02,685
<i>in the Champions League.</i>

1342
01:55:02,687 --> 01:55:05,987
<i>Where she has a chance
at becoming Final Champion...</i>

1343
01:55:05,989 --> 01:55:08,592
<i>and going to Zalem.</i>

1344
01:55:36,388 --> 01:55:40,155
Alita! Alita! Alita!

1345
01:55:40,157 --> 01:55:44,761
<i>Let's hear it for
the Battle Angel herself...</i>

1346
01:55:44,763 --> 01:55:46,661
<i>number 99...</i>

1347
01:55:46,663 --> 01:55:50,165
<i>Alita!</i>

1348
01:56:29,608 --> 01:56:32,477
Alita! Alita! Alita!

1349
