Here you go. Pad Thai, no peanuts[^peanut].
[^peanut]: /ˈpiːnʌt/ plural noun: peanuts ; the oval seed of a tropical South American plant, often roasted and salted and eaten as a snack or used to make oil or animal feed.

Don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.

Here we go.

Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the 19th century.

They don't put the fork in their mouth,they use it to put the food on a spoon......which then goes into their mouth.

Sounds like you have company.
They're not going anywhere.

So you're coming home from work.
That's great. How was work?

You know, it's a Cheesecake Factory......people order cheesecake and I bring it to them.

So you kind of act as like a carbohydrate delivery system?

Yeah, call it whatever you want,I get minimum wage.

Yeah.

26
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,736
I was wondering
if you could help me out...

27
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,030
- Yes.
- Oh.

28
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,532
Okay, great, I'm having
some furniture delivered...

29
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,035
...and I may not be here, so, oh...

30
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,329
Hello.

00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,248
<font color="#E86CE4">(SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN)</font>

32
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,667
I'm sorry?

33
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,171
Haven't you ever been told
how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?

34
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,924
- No, I haven't.
- Get used to it.

35
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,176
Yeah, I probably won't.

36
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,303
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hi.

37
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,180
Hey, Raj.

38
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,475
Still not talking to me, huh?

39
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,685
Don't take it personally,
it's his pathology.

40
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,647
- He can't talk to women.
- He can't talk to attractive women.

41
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,316
Or in your case,
a cheesecake-scented goddess.

42
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,444
- There's gonna be some furniture delivered?
- Yeah.

43
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,198
If it gets here and I'm not here,
could you sign for it and put it in?

44
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,700
- Yeah, no problem.
- Great, here's my spare key.

45
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,494
Thank you.

46
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,038
- Penny, wait.
- Yeah?

47
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,791
Um...

48
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,043
If you don't have any other plans...

49
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,380
...do you wanna join us for Thai food
and a Superman movie marathon?

50
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,341
A marathon? Wow, how many
Superman movies are there?

51
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,636
You're kidding, right?

52
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,514
I do like the one where
Lois Lane falls from the helicopter...

53
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,974
...and Superman catches her.

54
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,560
- Which one was that?
- One.

55
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,564
You realize that scene was rife
with scientific inaccuracy?

56
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,482
Yes, I know, men can't fly.

57
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,151
No, let's assume that they can.

58
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,237
Lois Lane is falling.

59
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,865
Accelerating at an initial rate
of 32 feet per second.

60
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:41,076
Superman swoops down to save her
by reaching out two arms of steel.

61
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,995
Miss Lane, who is now traveling...

62
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,581
...at approximately
120 miles an hour, hits them...

63
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,709
...and is immediately
sliced into three equal pieces.

64
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:53,422
Unless Superman
matches her speed and decelerates.

65
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,299
In what space, sir? In what space?

66
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,884
She's 2 feet above the ground.

67
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,095
If he really loved her,
he'd let her hit the pavement.

68
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,598
- It would be a more merciful death.
- That doesn't...

69
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:06,518
Excuse me, your entire argument
is predicated on the assumption...

70
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,021
...that Superman's flight
is a feat of strength.

71
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,606
Are you listening to yourself?

72
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,941
Superman's flight is a feat of strength.

73
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,360
An extension of his ability
to leap buildings...

74
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,654
...an ability he derives
from exposure to sun...

75
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,698
How does he fly at night?

76
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,992
A combination
of the moon's solar reflection...

77
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,204
...and the energy storage capacity
of Kryptonian skin cells.

78
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,290
I'm just gonna go wash up.

79
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,292
I have 2600 comic books in there.

80
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,046
I challenge you to find a single reference
to Kryptonian skin cells.

81
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,465
Challenge accepted.

82
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,719
We're locked out.

83
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,055
Also, the pretty girl left.

84
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,331
Okay.

85
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,751
Her apartment's on the fourth floor,
elevator is broken, you're gonna...

86
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,462
Oh, you're just gonna be done?
Okay, cool, thanks.

87
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,676
- I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.
- I hardly think so.

88
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,803
Why not?

89
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,554
Well, we don't have a dolly...

90
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:28,475
...or lifting belts,
or any measurable upper-body strength.

91
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,311
We don't need strength.
We're physicists.

92
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,814
We are the intellectual
descendents of Archimedes.

93
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,525
Give me a fulcrum and a lever
and I can move the Earth.

94
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,361
It's just a matter... I don't have this!
I do not have this!

95
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,073
Archimedes would be so proud.

96
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,580
Do you have any ideas?

97
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,875
Yes, but they all involve
a Green Lantern and a power ring.

98
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,964
Easy. Easy.

99
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,803
Okay. Now we've got an inclined plane.

100
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,432
Force required to lift is reduced
by the sine of the angle of the stairs...

101
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,475
...call it 30 degrees, so about half.

102
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:15,105
Exactly half.

103
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,400
Let's push.

104
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,778
Okay.

105
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,031
See, it's moving. This is easy.

106
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,615
It's all in the math.

107
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,244
- What's your formula for the corner?
- What?

108
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,707
Oh, okay.

109
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,962
Okay, yeah, no problem.
Just come up here, help me pull and turn.

110
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,970
Oh, gravity, thou art a heatless bitch.

111
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,098
You do understand
that our efforts here...

112
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:54,770
...will in no way increase the odds of you
having sexual congress with this woman?

113
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,814
Men do things for women
without expecting sex.

114
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,067
Yeah, those would be men
who just had sex.

115
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,653
I'm doing this to be a good neighbor.

116
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,991
In any case, there's no way
it could lower the odds.

117
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,789
Almost there.

118
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,624
- Almost there.
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: No, we're not.

119
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,001
- No, we're not. No, we're not.
- I'm sorry.

120
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,587
- Watch your fingers.
- Yeah.

121
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,215
Oh, God, my fingers!

122
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,968
- You okay?
- No, it hurt...

123
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,347
Great Caesar's ghost, look at this place.

124
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,392
So Penny is a little messy.

125
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,227
A little messy?

126
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,313
The Mandelbrot set
of complex numbers is a little messy.

127
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,606
This is chaos.

128
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,733
Excuse me.

129
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,193
Explain to me a system...

130
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,530
...where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid?

131
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,657
I'm just inferring that this is a couch...

132
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,786
...because the evidence suggests
the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.

133
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,998
Did it occur to you that not everyone
has the compulsive need to sort...

134
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,626
...organize and label
the entire world around them?

135
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,129
No.

136
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,297
Well, they don't.

137
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,924
Hard as it may be to believe...

138
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,595
...most people don't sort their breakfast
cereal numerically by fiber content.

139
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,349
Excuse me, but I think
we've both found that helpful at times.

140
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,813
- Come on, we should go.
- Hang on.

141
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,650
- What are you doing?
- I'm straightening up.

142
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,694
Sheldon, this is not your home.

143
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,448
This is not anyone's home.
This is a swirling vortex of entropy.

144
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,703
When the transvestite lived here,
you didn't care how he kept the place.

145
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,079
Because it was immaculate.

146
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,248
I mean, you open that man's closet...

147
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:43,712
...it was left to right, evening gowns,
cocktail dresses and his police uniforms.

148
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,091
- What were you doing in his closet?
- I helped him run some cable for a webcam.

149
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,051
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Penny.

150
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,345
This just arrived.
Brought this up. Just now.

151
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,723
Great. Was it hard getting up the stairs?

152
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,057
- No.
- No?

153
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,895
- No.
- No.

154
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,063
- We'll get out of your hair.
- Okay, great.

155
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,274
Thank you again.

156
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,944
Penny?

157
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,989
I just want you to know
that you don't have to live like this.

158
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,783
I'm here for you.

159
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,245
What's he talking about?

160
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,998
- It's a joke.
- I don't get it.

161
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,583
Yeah, he didn't tell it right.

Penny's sleeping.

167
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,186
Are you insane?

168
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,982
You can't break into a woman's apartment
in the middle of the night and clean.

169
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,149
I had no choice.

170
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,820
I couldn't sleep knowing that just
outside my bedroom was our living room...

171
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,281
...and outside our living room
was that hallway...

172
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,742
...and immediately adjacent
to that hallway was this.

173
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,912
Do you realize that if Penny wakes up...

174
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,915
...there is no reasonable explanation
as to why we're here?

175
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,835
I just gave you a reasonable explanation.

176
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,796
No, no. You gave me an explanation.

177
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,300
It's reasonableness will be determined

Yes, but only to clean.

And snoring.
And that's probably just a sinus infection.

But it could be sleep apnea. You might
wanna see an otorhinolaryngologist.

or a general surgeon.

345
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,389
- Here and here.
- Also inefficient, and might be loud.

346
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,100
How about a liquid cooler?
A little aquarium pump here.

347
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,768
Run some quarter-inch PVC...

348
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,770
Guys, this is actually really simple.

349
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,106
Hold on, honey, men at work.

350
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,945
PVC comes here. Maybe a little
corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.

351
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,574
Show me where we put a drip tray,
a sluice and a overflow reservoir?

352
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,660
If water's involved,
we'll ground the crap out of the thing.

353
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:08,497
Guys, it's hot in here.
I think I'll just take off all my clothes.

354
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,962
Oh, I've got it.

355
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:20,718
What if we replaced panels A, B and F and
crossbar H with aircraft-grade aluminum?

356
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,054
- Entire thing's one big heat sink.
- Perfect.

357
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,807
Leonard and Sheldon, go to the junkyard
and pick up 6 square meters of aluminum.

358
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,769
- Raj and I will get the oxyacetylene torch.
- Meet in an hour?

359
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,687
- Done.
- Got it.

360
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,859
Okay, this place does look pretty good.
