00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:32,448
What the hell's the point
of having a beeper

184
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,710
if you're not gonna
turn it on?

185
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:35,547
It was turned on.
I was ignoring you.

186
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:36,712
Hello.
What's the, uh...

187
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:38,220
What's
the big emergency?

188
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:39,722
It started this morning.

189
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:41,724
Every station's making
like it's the 1950s.

190
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:43,726
We got static.
We got snow.

191
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:45,056
All kinds
of distortions.

192
00:09:45,163 --> 00:09:46,391
- Nobody knows--
- Marty--

193
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:47,522
What the hell
are you doing?

194
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:48,564
There's a reason

195
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:49,725
we have bins
labeled " recycle."

196
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,233
What the hell
is going on?

197
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:52,234
My God in heaven.

198
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:55,238
So sue me. David!
We got a problem.

199
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,740
Did you try to switch
transponder channels?

200
00:09:57,842 --> 00:09:59,742
Oh, please.
You think I'd be this panicked

201
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:01,243
if it was something simple?

202
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:03,644
OK. Let's point the dish
at another satellite.

203
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:06,478
We tried that.
It didn't work.

204
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:08,848
It's almost as though
they weren't even there.

205
00:10:08,953 --> 00:10:11,649
All right. All right.
What've we got here?

206
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:17,827
This is impossible.

207
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:20,830
TV: We created
a race of robots.

208
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:21,830
Their function...

209
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:23,924
Miguel, the signal's
all screwed up.

210
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:25,627
Stop it.
Just leave it alone.

211
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:27,364
You're gonna break it,
all right?

212
00:10:27,472 --> 00:10:28,666
It's so fuzzy.

213
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:33,411
[Horn Honks]

214
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:35,877
[Horn Honks]

215
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,880
Oh, no.

216
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,784
Good morning, Lucas.

217
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,288
You see these?

218
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:48,825
I got a whole god damn
crop full of these.

219
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:50,827
If your father's
not in the air

220
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:52,294
in 20 minutes...

221
00:10:52,397 --> 00:10:54,126
I'm getting
someone else.

222
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:03,034
Hey!

223
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:04,039
Russell!

224
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:05,871
Hey, Miguel!

225
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:09,413
Ha ha ha ha ha!

226
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:11,141
Whoaaaa!

227
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:15,183
Whooooo!

228
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:19,085
Yahhhh-hoooo!

229
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,556
Russell!
What are you doing?

230
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:22,990
Whoo!

231
00:11:37,308 --> 00:11:39,640
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

232
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:40,642
Whoa! Ohh!

233
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:42,076
Oh!

234
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:45,306
It's the wrong field,
you idiot.

235
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:48,147
Lucas' farm is
on the other side of town.

236
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:51,222
[Rooster Crows]

237
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:53,722
Are you sure?

238
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:01,988
[Speaking Spanish]

239
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:08,403
[Rumbling]

240
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:34,196
CNS is running a story
that we're covering up

241
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:35,857
some type of nuclear
testing experiment.

242
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,366
Tell them to run with it

243
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:38,868
if they want to
embarrass themselves.

244
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,870
NASA's been on my butt
all morning.

245
00:12:40,972 --> 00:12:42,371
They want to know
our position.

246
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:43,873
Our official position is

247
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:45,374
we have no official
position.

248
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:47,377
Connie,
what is going on here?

249
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,379
Come on, would I keep you
out of the loop?

250
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:51,005
- Yes, absolutely.
- In a second.

251
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:52,878
What? I can't hear you.

252
00:12:52,984 --> 00:12:54,281
At the moment,

253
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:55,784
our satellites are
somewhat unreliable.

254
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:56,876
Isn't it possible

255
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:58,888
that this thing may
just pass us by?

256
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,890
What if it doesn't
"pass us by" ?

257
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:03,654
Let's retarget some ICBMs
to blow it outta the sky.

258
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:05,160
And risk turning one
dangerous falling object

259
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:06,355
into many?

260
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:07,362
We don't yet know
enough

261
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:08,591
about what
we're dealing with

262
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,600
to make any kind
of intelligent judgments.

263
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:12,602
Luckily, the press is
making up their own story

264
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:13,728
at this point.

265
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:15,567
But that's not
gonna keep.

266
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:18,073
We may need to upgrade
to Defcon Three.

267
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:19,575
Absolutely.
General, contact NORAD.

268
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:21,645
You tell them we've upgraded
to Defcon Three.

269
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:23,873
That's not what
the president said.

270
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:24,880
That's a little
premature.

271
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:25,950
I don't think so.

272
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,915
We have more than 50%
of the armed forces

273
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:28,951
out on weekend leave,

274
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:31,419
not to mention
the commanders and troops

275
00:13:31,523 --> 00:13:32,649
that are in town
for the 4th ofJuly parade.

276
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:34,088
Go ahead, Commander.

277
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:35,250
Our intelligence
tells us

278
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,520
the object has settled
into a stationary orbit.

279
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:38,027
Well, that's
good news.

280
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:39,323
Uh, not really, sir.

281
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,590
Part of it
has broken off

282
00:13:40,698 --> 00:13:41,790
into nearly three
dozen other pieces...

283
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:42,833
smaller than
the whole, sir,

284
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:47,545
yet over 15 miles
in width themselves.

285
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:52,754
Where are
they heading?

286
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:55,257
They should be entering
our atmosphere

287
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,259
within
the next 25 minutes.

288
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,297
Take us to Defcon Three.

289
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:08,506
[Beeping]

290
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:10,303
[Beeping]

291
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:17,513
Please tell me we're
gettin' somewhere.

292
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:19,276
Oh, there's good news,
and there's bad news.

293
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:21,010
All right,
what's the bad news?

294
00:14:21,118 --> 00:14:22,642
The bad news is that
you're in meal penalty

295
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:23,811
for disturbing my lunch.

296
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:26,151
And the good news is
you're not gonna charge me.

297
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:28,691
Uh, no. The good news is
that I've found the problem.

298
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:30,192
It's not our equipment.

299
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:32,285
There's some kinda weird signal
embedded in the satellite feed.

300
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:33,328
And that's the good news?

301
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:34,830
Yeah, 'cause this signal

302
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:35,990
has a definite
sequential pattern,

303
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,829
so as soon as I find
the exact binary sequence,

304
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:39,835
then I can calculate
the phase reversal

305
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:40,926
with that analyzer

306
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:42,369
I built you for your
birthday and apply it,

307
00:14:42,473 --> 00:14:44,566
we should be able to
block it out completely.

308
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,609
And then we'll be
the only guys in town

309
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,076
with a clear picture?!

310
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,578
Yes! Yes! Yes!

311
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,908
Oh, David,
that's why I love you!

312
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:51,949
I know.
That's unnecessary.

313
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:52,983
Oh, yes! Yes!

314
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,017
You're too kind.

315
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:12,867
[Rumbling]

316
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:24,707
This better be good.

317
00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:26,042
Captain on deck!

318
00:15:28,952 --> 00:15:31,853
Sir, we're looking
at a total radar blackout

319
00:15:31,955 --> 00:15:33,354
over a 13 kilometer area.

320
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:34,855
Let's do a diagnostic
check--

321
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,016
Excuse me, sir.

322
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,524
The radar may be
malfunctioning,

323
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:38,616
but the infrared

324
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:40,457
is totally
off the map.

325
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:45,492
Jeez.

326
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:50,098
Get me Atlantic Command
on the line.

327
00:15:53,476 --> 00:15:54,875
Hang on, sir.

328
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:56,536
Sir, we have
visual range

329
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:58,204
with incoming
over Iraqi airspace.

330
00:15:58,314 --> 00:15:59,440
Second sighting?

331
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:02,712
Yes, sir. This just came in
from the Persian Gulf.

332
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:03,911
Correction, sir.

333
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,920
We now have two
confirmed visual contacts.

334
00:16:06,022 --> 00:16:07,284
That's affirmative.
Mr. President.

335
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,790
They're tracking another one
off the California coastline.

336
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:10,790
[Whispers]

337
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:12,793
All right, go ahead.
Put it on.

338
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:14,795
General, you might
want to watch this.

339
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,499
TV: Ladies and gentlemen...

340
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:20,000
ladies and gentlemen,

341
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:21,593
we are interrupting
our regular broadcast

342
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:23,262
to bring you
extraordinary events

343
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,364
taking place
in the Russian Republic.

344
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:26,874
This unexplained disturbance

345
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:28,136
and the hysteria
that it's causing

346
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:29,336
are incredible.

347
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:30,844
Woman: How
would you describe

348
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:31,879
what you're seeing?

349
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:33,881
It is clearing
the mountains...

350
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:35,848
moving too slowly

351
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:38,352
to be a comet
or meteor.

352
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:41,890
Widespread panic has
gripped the countryside

353
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:44,357
as thousands have
taken to the streets.

354
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,859
It is confirmed.

355
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:47,589
The unexplained
phenomenon

356
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:49,096
is headed
for Moscow.

357
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:50,096
Mr. President,

358
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:51,598
we have an AWAC
off the West Coast.

359
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:54,966
ETA with contact point:
three minutes.

360
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:56,971
I don't
understand it, sir.

361
00:16:57,073 --> 00:16:57,971
Side radar

satellite disruption.

1079

All right. Go ahead.

1080
00:45:17,688 --> 00:45:18,586
OK.

1081
00:45:18,689 --> 00:45:20,418
Um...

1082
00:45:20,524 --> 00:45:23,891
Let's say that you want to
coordinate with spaceships

1083
00:45:23,994 --> 00:45:25,825
on different sides
of the Earth.

1084
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,592
You couldn't send
a direct signal, right?

1085
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,631
You're talking about
line of sight.

1086
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:33,134
Yeah, that's right.
Exactly.

1087
00:45:33,237 --> 00:45:34,898
The curve of the Earth
prevents it.

1088
00:45:35,005 --> 00:45:36,302
You'd need satellites
to relay that signal

1089
00:45:36,407 --> 00:45:38,375
in order to reach
each ship.

1090
00:45:38,476 --> 00:45:40,910
Well, I found a signal

1091
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:44,777

satellite system.

They're starting.

1095
00:45:52,122 --> 00:45:55,523
They're using our own
satellites against us...

1096
00:45:59,129 --> 00:46:00,494
and the clock is ticking.

with the Atlantic Command.

00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:27,389
Tell them to evacuate
as many people

1104

out of the cities
as they can.

This may be some type
of response, Echo One.

00:59:11,655 --> 00:59:13,953
I'm sure she got out of here
before it happened.

1256
00:59:14,057 --> 00:59:18,357
Or, as the good reverend
would say,

1257
00:59:18,461 --> 00:59:19,860
[Imitating JesseJackson]

1258
00:59:19,963 --> 00:59:22,431
" Why we're on this particular
mission we'll never know.

1259
00:59:22,532 --> 00:59:26,628
But I do know, here today,
that the Black Knights

1260
00:59:26,736 --> 00:59:28,863
will emerge victorious
once again.''

1261
00:59:28,972 --> 00:59:30,667
Amen, man.

00:59:30,774 --> 00:59:32,071
Amen, Reverend.

Are they not
getting through?

1278
01:00:41,211 --> 01:00:42,803
No, sir. Not one.

Come on. Come on.

1287
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:13,069
They must have some kind
of protective shield

1288
01:01:13,176 --> 01:01:14,165
over their hull.

1289
01:01:14,277 --> 01:01:15,335

Pull up! Pull up!

1290
01:01:20,917 --> 01:01:22,043
Knight 3, pull up!

1291
01:01:22,152 --> 01:01:24,120
Controls are showing
complete failure of the stats.

1292
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,949
Pull up!

1293
01:01:26,055 --> 01:01:27,352
Aah!

1294
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,691
Blow through!
Blow through!

1295
01:01:35,799 --> 01:01:37,562
There's so many
of them!

1296
01:01:39,135 --> 01:01:40,762
Aah!

1297
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:42,497
They got
another one, sir.

1298
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:48,878
Oh, no. You did not shoot
that green shit at me.

1299
01:01:51,848 --> 01:01:52,872
I've got you covered,
big daddy.

1300
01:01:57,754 --> 01:01:58,914
Damn. They got
shields, too.

1301
01:02:10,233 --> 01:02:11,564
Let's go, Knights.
Move, Knights, move!

1302
01:02:15,538 --> 01:02:16,800
Aah!

1303
01:02:16,906 --> 01:02:18,635
Jesus.

1304
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:20,902
They got another one, sir.
Two more just went down.

1305
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:22,136
They're dropping
like flies.

1306
01:02:22,245 --> 01:02:23,303
We're losing them.

1307
01:02:23,413 --> 01:02:25,176
All right. Get them
out of there.

1308
01:02:25,281 --> 01:02:27,374
Squadron leaders, retreat
to fallback positions.

1309
01:02:27,484 --> 01:02:29,315
Abort mission right away.
Do you read me?

1310
01:02:29,419 --> 01:02:30,317
Do you copy?

1311
01:02:33,756 --> 01:02:35,986
We're going to have to make
a run for this one here.

1312
01:02:36,092 --> 01:02:37,320
Let's get low.
Let's get fast.

1313
01:02:37,427 --> 01:02:39,452
I got you, big daddy.
Let's get them.

1314
01:02:39,562 --> 01:02:40,790
Whoo!

1315
01:02:41,998 --> 01:02:42,896
Watch the deck.

1316
01:02:51,641 --> 01:02:53,472
Squadron Leader,
do you read?

1317
01:02:53,576 --> 01:02:55,441
This isn't happening
fast enough.

1318
01:02:55,545 --> 01:02:56,569
Get them out of there!

1319
01:03:03,386 --> 01:03:05,616
What's with the monitor?
Where's the picture?

1320
01:03:05,722 --> 01:03:06,780
We've lost
the satellite.

1321
01:03:10,927 --> 01:03:13,122

Jimmy. Check them.

1322
01:03:13,229 --> 01:03:14,890

1323
01:03:15,999 --> 01:03:17,796
Come on, come on.
Move, move, move!

1324
01:03:19,202 --> 01:03:20,897
He's on me like white
on rice, big daddy.

1325
01:03:21,004 --> 01:03:21,971
They ain't got
nothing for us.

1326
01:03:22,071 --> 01:03:23,732
Let's push it.
We've got to go.

1327
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,569
I can't shake him.
I can't shake him.

1328
01:03:25,675 --> 01:03:27,108
Yes, you can.
Just the way I showed you.

1329
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,269
Check me out. I'm going
to try something.

1330
01:03:29,379 --> 01:03:30,812
Don't do nothing stupid
over there.

1331
01:03:30,914 --> 01:03:31,812
You know me.

1332
01:03:31,915 --> 01:03:33,382
That's what
I'm talking about.

1333
01:03:33,483 --> 01:03:35,781
Jimmy, what are you doing?
You can't bank at that speed.

1334
01:03:36,986 --> 01:03:37,884
Jimmy, he's closing on you!

1335
01:03:41,658 --> 01:03:43,558
Put your mask back on!
That's an order!

1336
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,888
I can't breathe!

1337
01:03:46,229 --> 01:03:47,526
Jimmy!

1338
01:03:48,831 --> 01:03:50,059
Jimmy!

1339
01:03:52,535 --> 01:03:53,934
Jimmy! No!

1340
01:03:54,037 --> 01:03:55,629
That's affirmative.
We have incoming.

1341
01:03:55,738 --> 01:03:56,636
Let me have it, son.

1342
01:03:56,739 --> 01:03:58,570
You got it.

1343
01:03:58,675 --> 01:04:00,768
Friendly?

1344
01:04:00,877 --> 01:04:02,139
Sergeant?

1345
01:04:02,245 --> 01:04:03,610
I don't think so.

1346
01:04:05,915 --> 01:04:08,179
[Alarm Sounds]

1347
01:04:08,284 --> 01:04:09,911
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1348
01:04:31,741 --> 01:04:33,140
Come on and get me!
Come and get me!

1349
01:04:37,013 --> 01:04:38,913
Oh, what are you
shooting at?

1350
01:04:40,183 --> 01:04:42,811
Where you at, baby?
Come on! Come on!

1351
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:49,485
Aw, you can't hit nothing!

1352
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,830
Aah!

1353
01:04:55,932 --> 01:04:57,524
Ha! Ha!

1354
01:05:06,676 --> 01:05:08,576
Whoa! Low bridge!

1355
01:05:12,982 --> 01:05:14,813
See if you can fly
that thing undercover.

1356
01:05:18,488 --> 01:05:21,321
Ha ha. Hope you got
an air bag.

1357
01:05:23,192 --> 01:05:24,352
Whoa!

1358
01:05:46,149 --> 01:05:47,912
Aah! Unh!

1359
01:05:48,017 --> 01:05:50,508
[Gasping]

1360
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,281
Aah! Unh!

1361
01:05:58,628 --> 01:06:00,528
Son of a bitch.

1362
01:06:02,665 --> 01:06:04,656
Aah!

1363
01:06:04,767 --> 01:06:06,962
That's right!
That's right!

1364
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,833
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

1365
01:06:08,938 --> 01:06:10,405
That's what you get!

1366
01:06:10,506 --> 01:06:12,474
Ha ha!
Look at you!

1367
01:06:12,575 --> 01:06:14,133
Ship all banged up!

1368
01:06:14,243 --> 01:06:15,540
Who's the man?

1369
01:06:15,645 --> 01:06:17,237
Huh? Who's the man?

1370
01:06:17,346 --> 01:06:18,779
Wait until I get
another plane!

1371
01:06:18,881 --> 01:06:21,372
I'm lining all your friends
up right beside you!

1372
01:06:22,952 --> 01:06:24,249
Where you at, huh?

1373
01:06:24,353 --> 01:06:25,684
Huh? Where you at?

1374
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,625
Welcome to Earth.

1375
01:06:49,812 --> 01:06:52,804
Now, that's what I call
a close encounter.

1376
01:06:57,086 --> 01:06:57,984
Baby,
stay right here.

1377
01:06:58,087 --> 01:06:59,645
Stay right here
with Boomer.

1378
01:07:09,065 --> 01:07:10,191
Keys.

1379
01:07:10,299 --> 01:07:12,096
Come on. Keys.

1380
01:07:12,201 --> 01:07:13,099
Yes!

1381
01:07:13,202 --> 01:07:15,170
Come on, baby.
Come on.

1382
01:07:15,238 --> 01:07:16,205
Come on.

1383
01:07:16,272 --> 01:07:17,239
Yes!

1384
01:07:18,598 --> 01:07:20,327
Radio: Reports indicate
that this battle

1385
01:07:20,433 --> 01:07:22,230
has repeated itself
all over the world

1386
01:07:22,335 --> 01:07:24,235
with the exact
same results.

1387
01:07:24,337 --> 01:07:26,805
You're just like your
mother, you know that?

1388
01:07:26,907 --> 01:07:29,137
She was stubborn, too.

1389
01:07:29,242 --> 01:07:31,142
Had to twist her arm

1390
01:07:31,244 --> 01:07:33,644
to get her
to take her medicine.

1391
01:07:33,747 --> 01:07:35,772
You're gonna
be all right.

1392
01:07:35,882 --> 01:07:36,940
You're gonna be fine.

1393
01:07:39,452 --> 01:07:43,320
See, Troy? You're
feeling better already.

1394
01:07:43,423 --> 01:07:45,823
I couldn't find anything.

1395
01:07:45,926 --> 01:07:47,587
Everyone's packing up.
They're leaving.

1396
01:07:47,694 --> 01:07:49,685
They said there's a spaceship
heading this way.

1397
01:07:49,796 --> 01:07:51,229
We'd better leave,
too, then.

1398
01:07:51,331 --> 01:07:53,094
[Knocking]

1399
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:54,131
Penicillin.

1400
01:07:54,234 --> 01:07:56,031
At least it'll help
keep his fever down.

1401
01:07:56,136 --> 01:07:57,034
Oh, thank you.

1402
01:07:57,137 --> 01:07:59,367
It's really nice
of you to help us.

1403
01:07:59,472 --> 01:08:01,906
I wish I could do more,
but we're moving out.

1404
01:08:02,008 --> 01:08:04,306
I-I'm going with you.

1405
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,080
Um...Well, I--I just--

1406
01:08:09,182 --> 01:08:11,412
I mean, that--that
we're going, too.

1407
01:08:11,518 --> 01:08:12,644
Cool.

1408
01:08:12,752 --> 01:08:15,846
Tell that punk to shut
the door. We're outta here.

1409
01:08:15,956 --> 01:08:17,389
Go sniff around
somewhere else.

1410
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:18,388
- Bye.
- Bye.

1411
01:08:23,728 --> 01:08:25,696
Uhh...

1412
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:29,189
It's Air Force One,
for crying out loud.

1413
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,267
Still he gets sick.

1414
01:08:30,368 --> 01:08:32,427
Oh, boy.
I don't feel so good.

1415
01:08:32,537 --> 01:08:34,368
Look at me, huh?
Like a rock.

1416
01:08:34,472 --> 01:08:35,803
Could be bad weather,
could be good weather.

1417
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:36,965
It doesn't matter.

1418
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:38,406
We could go up.
We could go down.

1419
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:40,273
We can go back.
We can go forward.

1420
01:08:40,378 --> 01:08:41,504
We can go
side to side--

1421
01:08:44,716 --> 01:08:45,614
What'd I say?

1422
01:08:47,852 --> 01:08:49,945
He still
gets airsick, huh?

1423
01:08:50,055 --> 01:08:51,488
Yeah.

1424
01:08:51,589 --> 01:08:54,820
Julius, with
all of this, I, uh...

1425
01:08:54,926 --> 01:08:58,362
I didn't get a chance
to thank you two.

1426
01:08:58,463 --> 01:09:00,693
All he could think of
was getting to you.

1427
01:09:03,568 --> 01:09:05,798
There's still love there,
I think.

1428
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,305
Love was never
our problem.

1429
01:09:10,408 --> 01:09:13,275
" All you need is love."

1430
01:09:13,378 --> 01:09:14,436
John Lennon.

1431
01:09:14,546 --> 01:09:15,604
Smart man.

1432
01:09:15,714 --> 01:09:17,648
Shot in the back.
Very sad.

1433
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:20,884
We've moved
as many of our forces

1434
01:09:20,985 --> 01:09:22,646
away from our bases
as possible,

1435
01:09:22,754 --> 01:09:25,154
but we've already
sustained heavy losses.

1436
01:09:25,256 --> 01:09:27,156
I spoke with the joint chiefs
when they arrived at NORAD.

1437
01:09:27,258 --> 01:09:29,749
They agree we must launch
a counteroffensive

1438
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:31,590
with a full
nuclear strike.

1439
01:09:31,696 --> 01:09:33,220
Over American soil?

1440
01:09:33,331 --> 01:09:34,389
You're saying,
at this point,

1441
01:09:34,499 --> 01:09:35,727
we should sacrifice
more innocent

1442
01:09:35,834 --> 01:09:37,734
American civilians?
Is that right?

1443
01:09:37,836 --> 01:09:39,133
Sir, if we don't
strike soon

1444
01:09:39,237 --> 01:09:41,102
there may not be much
of an America left to defend.

1445
01:09:41,206 --> 01:09:43,174
Sir, they've
taken out NORAD.

1446
01:09:43,274 --> 01:09:44,172
What?

1447
01:09:44,275 --> 01:09:45,299
It's gone, sir.

1448
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:47,241
My God.

1449
01:09:47,345 --> 01:09:49,813
The vice president,
joint chiefs.

1450
01:09:49,914 --> 01:09:52,382
Mr. President,

1451
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:53,974
we must launch.

1452
01:09:54,085 --> 01:09:55,677
A delay now
would be more costly

1453
01:09:55,787 --> 01:09:58,654
than when you waited
to evacuate the cities.

1454
01:09:58,757 --> 01:10:00,281
No, no. You're not going
to launch nuclear weapons.

1455
01:10:00,391 --> 01:10:02,450
You're going to kill them
and us at the same time.

1456
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,959
If we fire nukes,

1457
01:10:04,062 --> 01:10:04,960
then everybody else
is going to fire them.

1458
01:10:05,063 --> 01:10:06,030
You are a guest here.

1459
01:10:06,131 --> 01:10:07,029
Ever hear of
nuclear winter?

1460
01:10:07,132 --> 01:10:08,929
It's the end of life
as we know it.

1461
01:10:09,033 --> 01:10:09,931
Do you hear what
they're talking about?

1462
01:10:10,034 --> 01:10:10,932
Don't even think
about it.

1463
01:10:11,035 --> 01:10:12,059
I don't have to go.

1464
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,102
It can't be allowed.

1465
01:10:13,204 --> 01:10:14,933
Shut up! Captain,
get him out of here!

1466
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,165
Hey, don't tell him
to shut up!

1467
01:10:18,276 --> 01:10:21,541
You'd all be dead now
if it wasn't for my David.

1468
01:10:21,646 --> 01:10:23,273
None of you did anything
to prevent this.

1469
01:10:23,381 --> 01:10:24,678
There was nothing
we could do.

1470
01:10:24,783 --> 01:10:27,115
We were totally
unprepared for this.

1471
01:10:27,218 --> 01:10:28,583
Aw! Don't give me
unprepared.

1472
01:10:28,686 --> 01:10:29,675
Come on,Julius.

1473
01:10:29,788 --> 01:10:32,655
It was in the 1950s.
You had that spaceship.

1474
01:10:32,757 --> 01:10:34,156
David: Dad.

1475
01:10:34,259 --> 01:10:37,023
Julius: Yeah, that thing
that you found in New Mexico.

1476
01:10:37,128 --> 01:10:39,323
Dad, no.
Not the spaceship.

1477
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:40,692
Roswell.
Roswell, New Mexico. Yeah.

1478
01:10:40,799 --> 01:10:43,267
You had the spaceship,
and you had the bodies.

1479
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:44,426
They were all
locked up in a bunker.

1480
01:10:44,536 --> 01:10:45,696
Where was that?

1481
01:10:45,804 --> 01:10:48,398
David?
In Area 51, right?

1482
01:10:48,506 --> 01:10:49,905
Area 51.

1483
01:10:50,008 --> 01:10:51,839
You knew then,
and you did nothing.

1484
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:54,777
Sir, regardless of what

1485
01:10:54,879 --> 01:10:58,007
you may have read
in the tabloids,

1486
01:10:58,116 --> 01:11:00,175
there have never been
any spacecraft

1487
01:11:00,285 --> 01:11:02,116
recovered
by our government.

1488
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,950
Take my word for it,
there's no Area 51.

1489
01:11:05,056 --> 01:11:06,990
There's no
recovered spaceship.

1490
01:11:07,091 --> 01:11:10,219
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. President?

1491
01:11:10,328 --> 01:11:14,230
That's not
entirely accurate.

1492
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:21,800
What? Which part?

1493
01:11:27,044 --> 01:11:29,410
Hold on, everybody!
Hold on!

1494
01:11:30,647 --> 01:11:32,342
Sorry.

1495
01:11:50,033 --> 01:11:51,967
The end hath come!

1496
01:11:52,069 --> 01:11:55,630
He spaketh His word,
and the end hath come!

1497
01:11:55,739 --> 01:11:56,637
Hop on!

1498
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:59,072
We're heading out
to El Toro.

1499
01:11:59,176 --> 01:12:02,873
You cannot defy
what hath come.

1500
01:12:02,979 --> 01:12:04,503
It is the end!

1501
01:12:04,614 --> 01:12:05,774
[Sobbing]

1502
01:12:10,153 --> 01:12:12,314
El Toro?!

1503
01:12:18,544 --> 01:12:20,444
Jasmine: Can you
give me a hand?

1504
01:12:20,546 --> 01:12:21,604
Yeah, sure.

1505
01:12:29,589 --> 01:12:30,556
Oh, my God.

1506
01:12:34,727 --> 01:12:37,457
[Boomer Barks]

1507
01:12:37,563 --> 01:12:39,690
OK, OK. Let's--
Let's get this off.

1508
01:12:39,799 --> 01:12:41,426
Here. Let me help you.

1509
01:12:45,238 --> 01:12:47,138
She's hurt
pretty badly.

1510
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:55,570
You know, this was supposed
to be my weekend off.

1511
01:12:55,682 --> 01:12:57,980
But no.

1512
01:12:58,084 --> 01:13:01,019
You got me out here
dragging your heavy ass

1513
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,644
through
the burning desert,

1514
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:04,154
with your dreadlocks

1515
01:13:04,257 --> 01:13:05,485
sticking out the back
of my parachute.

1516
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:08,492
You've got to come down here
with an attitude,

1517
01:13:08,594 --> 01:13:10,653
acting all big and bad.

1518
01:13:12,799 --> 01:13:15,962
And what the hell
is that smell?!

1519
01:13:16,069 --> 01:13:17,832
Aah!

1520
01:13:19,639 --> 01:13:21,197
I could've been
at a barbecue!

1521
01:13:22,976 --> 01:13:24,170
But I ain't mad.

1522
01:13:24,277 --> 01:13:26,211
It's all right.

1523
01:13:26,312 --> 01:13:27,802
That is all right.

1524
01:13:43,029 --> 01:13:44,189
Hey!

1525
01:13:44,297 --> 01:13:46,162
Hey!

1526
01:13:46,265 --> 01:13:47,163
Hey!

1527
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:53,671
Hey!

1528
01:14:06,753 --> 01:14:08,914
You need a lift,
soldier?

1529
01:14:09,022 --> 01:14:10,387
When I flew overhead,

1530
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:12,014
I saw a base
not too far from here.

1531
01:14:15,261 --> 01:14:16,250
It ain't on the map.

1532
01:14:16,362 --> 01:14:19,559
Trust me. It's there.

1533
01:14:35,181 --> 01:14:36,375
Ten-hut!

1534
01:14:40,286 --> 01:14:42,550
Mr. President.
General.

1535
01:14:42,655 --> 01:14:44,384
Welcome to Area 51.

1536
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:45,514
Please follow me.

1537
01:14:47,427 --> 01:14:49,622
We're now 2 4 floors
beneath the surface,

1538
01:14:49,729 --> 01:14:52,562
and here's our main
research facility.

1539
01:14:52,665 --> 01:14:53,654
Let's see it.

1540
01:14:53,766 --> 01:14:54,755
I'm sorry, sir.
It's a clean room.

1541
01:14:54,867 --> 01:14:56,129
We have to keep it
static-free.

1542
01:14:56,235 --> 01:14:57,167
If we'll all
go to decontamination--

1543
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:59,500
Open the door.

1544
01:15:01,474 --> 01:15:02,634
Yes, sir.

1545
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:27,258
My God. Why the hell wasn't
I told about this place?

1546
01:15:27,366 --> 01:15:28,924
Two words,
Mr. President:

1547
01:15:29,035 --> 01:15:31,902
plausible
deniability.

1548
01:15:38,411 --> 01:15:39,969
I don't understand.

1549
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:41,478
Where does all this
come from?

1550
01:15:41,581 --> 01:15:43,981
How do you get funding
for something like this?

1551
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:45,482
You don't actually think

1552
01:15:45,585 --> 01:15:46,882
they spend $20,000
on a hammer,

1553
01:15:46,986 --> 01:15:49,454
$30,000 on a toilet seat,
do you?

1554
01:15:51,591 --> 01:15:54,082
Mr. President,
this is Dr. Okun.

1555
01:15:54,193 --> 01:15:55,353
He's been heading up
the research department

1556
01:15:55,461 --> 01:15:57,520
on this project
for the last 15 years.

1557
01:15:59,799 --> 01:16:01,266
How do you do.

1558
01:16:01,367 --> 01:16:04,165
Mr. President.

1559
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:06,431
Wow.

1560
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:10,339
This--
What a pleasure.

1561
01:16:10,443 --> 01:16:12,206
As you can imagine,

1562
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:13,972
they don't let us
out much.

1563
01:16:15,581 --> 01:16:17,344
I can understand that.

1564
01:16:19,252 --> 01:16:22,153
Well, I guess
you'd like to see

1565
01:16:22,255 --> 01:16:24,246
the big tamale, huh?

1566
01:16:24,357 --> 01:16:25,722
Follow me.

1567
01:16:35,201 --> 01:16:37,101
[Assistant
Enters Code]

1568
01:17:16,475 --> 01:17:18,875
She's a beaut,
ain't she?

1569
01:17:21,314 --> 01:17:22,303
Dr. Okun: As you can see
from the repairs,

1570
01:17:22,415 --> 01:17:24,110
we've been trying
to put her back together

1571
01:17:24,217 --> 01:17:26,617
since the late 1960s.

1572
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:27,777
Don't tell me

1573
01:17:27,887 --> 01:17:28,819
you've had this
for 40 years,

1574
01:17:28,921 --> 01:17:29,819
and you don't know
anything about them?

1575
01:17:29,922 --> 01:17:31,116
Oh, hell, no. No, no.

1576
01:17:31,224 --> 01:17:33,351
We know tons about them.

1577
01:17:33,459 --> 01:17:35,256
But the neatest stuff--
the neatest stuff

1578
01:17:35,361 --> 01:17:39,229
has only happened
in the last few days.

1579
01:17:39,332 --> 01:17:41,664
See, we can't duplicate
their type of power,

1580
01:17:41,767 --> 01:17:44,133
so we've never been able
to experiment.

1581
01:17:44,237 --> 01:17:45,602
But since these guys
started showing up,

1582
01:17:45,705 --> 01:17:50,039
all the little gizmos
inside turned on.

1583
01:17:50,142 --> 01:17:53,043
The last 2 4 hours have
been really exciting.

1584
01:17:53,145 --> 01:17:55,511
Exciting?
People are dying out there.

1585
01:17:55,615 --> 01:17:56,980
I don't think " exciting"

1586
01:17:57,083 --> 01:18:00,018
is the word I'd choose
to describe it.

1587
01:18:00,119 --> 01:18:02,212
You guys are hoping
to fly this thing, huh?

1588
01:18:02,321 --> 01:18:04,653
You said you can repair
their technology.

1589
01:18:04,757 --> 01:18:06,520
Can you tell us anything
useful about them?

1590
01:18:06,626 --> 01:18:08,116
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1591
01:18:08,227 --> 01:18:09,626
Well, I mean,

1592
01:18:09,729 --> 01:18:11,663
they're not all that
dissimilar from us.

1593
01:18:11,764 --> 01:18:13,698
Breathes oxygen.

1594
01:18:13,799 --> 01:18:16,063
Comparable tolerances
to heat, cold.

1595
01:18:16,168 --> 01:18:17,567
Probably why
they're interested

1596
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:19,865
in our planet.

1597
01:18:19,972 --> 01:18:21,496
Hey.

1598
01:18:21,607 --> 01:18:22,505
Hey.

1599
01:18:24,977 --> 01:18:26,239
You guys
want to see them?

1600
01:18:27,647 --> 01:18:29,274
Hmm?

1601
01:18:36,155 --> 01:18:40,182
This is--
This is the vault,

1602
01:18:40,293 --> 01:18:43,922
or as some of us have
come to call it,

1603
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:44,962
" The Freak Show."

1604
01:18:45,064 --> 01:18:47,430
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1605
01:18:47,533 --> 01:18:48,431
" The--"

1606
01:19:07,687 --> 01:19:09,780
When we found them,

1607
01:19:09,889 --> 01:19:13,825
they were wearing some sort
of biomechanical suits,

1608
01:19:13,926 --> 01:19:14,915
but once we got them off,

1609
01:19:15,027 --> 01:19:17,154
we learned a great deal
about their anatomy.

1610
01:19:17,263 --> 01:19:20,824
Eyes, ears,
no vocal chords.

1611
01:19:20,933 --> 01:19:22,958
We're assuming they
communicate with each other

1612
01:19:23,069 --> 01:19:24,832
through some other means.

1613
01:19:24,937 --> 01:19:25,995
You're obviously
not thinking about

1614
01:19:26,105 --> 01:19:28,335
hand signals
and body language.

1615
01:19:28,441 --> 01:19:29,339
It's
some kind of

1616
01:19:29,442 --> 01:19:31,273
extrasensory
perception.

1617
01:19:31,377 --> 01:19:32,708
Telepathy.

1618
01:19:34,013 --> 01:19:34,980
So...

1619
01:19:37,183 --> 01:19:39,310
It's an organic life form.

1620
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,312
Can they be killed?

1621
01:19:44,423 --> 01:19:46,084
Their bodies are
just as frail as ours.

1622
01:19:46,192 --> 01:19:48,285
These two
died in the crash.

1623
01:19:48,394 --> 01:19:50,726
This one,
a few weeks later.

1624
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:51,854
You just--

1625
01:19:51,964 --> 01:19:53,989
You have to get through
their technology,

1626
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,967
which is,
I'm sorry to say,

1627
01:19:57,069 --> 01:19:58,229
far more advanced.

1628
01:19:59,572 --> 01:20:03,099
David, you unlocked
part of that technology.

1629
01:20:03,209 --> 01:20:04,233
You cracked the code.

1630
01:20:04,343 --> 01:20:05,275
Oh, no, no.

1631
01:20:05,378 --> 01:20:07,903
All I did was stumble
onto their signal.

1632
01:20:08,013 --> 01:20:10,982
I don't know
how helpful I can be.

1633
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:15,110
Why don't you show them
what you've discovered so far,

1634
01:20:15,221 --> 01:20:18,554
figure out what they haven't
thought of yet,

1635
01:20:18,657 --> 01:20:20,056
and we'll see

1636
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,356
if you're as smart
as we all hope you are.

1637
01:20:33,372 --> 01:20:34,771
What code?

1638
01:20:54,927 --> 01:20:56,053
Captain Steven Hiller,

1639
01:20:56,162 --> 01:20:57,220
United States
Marine Corps.

1640
01:20:57,329 --> 01:20:59,490
I'm sorry, Captain.
This is a restricted area.

1641
01:20:59,598 --> 01:21:00,929
I can't let you pass
without clearance.

1642
01:21:01,033 --> 01:21:04,025
OK. Come here.

1643
01:21:04,136 --> 01:21:05,831
You want to see
my clearance?

1644
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:10,401
Maybe I'll just leave
this here with you.

1645
01:21:10,476 --> 01:21:11,443
Let them pass.

1646
01:21:12,859 --> 01:21:13,689
Let them pass.

1647
01:21:13,794 --> 01:21:15,989
Get the hell
out of the way.

1648
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:19,063
Did you see that?

1649
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:19,266
Come on down.

1650
01:21:19,266 --> 01:21:20,824
Come on down.

1651
01:21:22,235 --> 01:21:23,133
Watch your step.

1652
01:21:24,805 --> 01:21:28,639
Well, obviously, this cockpit
was designed to seat three,

1653
01:21:28,742 --> 01:21:31,233
though how they sat on that,
I don't know.

1654
01:21:31,344 --> 01:21:32,242
David: Gently.

1655
01:21:32,345 --> 01:21:34,870
Uh, you see
these gizmos flashing?

1656
01:21:34,981 --> 01:21:35,879
Yeah.

1657
01:21:35,982 --> 01:21:37,210
We've been working
around the clock

1658
01:21:37,317 --> 01:21:39,217
trying to get a fix
on all this crap.

1659
01:21:39,319 --> 01:21:40,980
Some stuff we
figured out right away.

1660
01:21:41,087 --> 01:21:42,987
Uh, this,
we're pretty sure,

1661
01:21:43,089 --> 01:21:45,649
is the life support
system for the cabin.

1662
01:21:45,759 --> 01:21:47,192
[Coughs] And, uh,

1663
01:21:47,294 --> 01:21:49,319
this doohickey
is connected to--

1664
01:21:49,429 --> 01:21:52,159
Oh...Well, it was

1665
01:21:52,265 --> 01:21:53,527
connected
to the engine.

1666
01:21:53,633 --> 01:21:55,624
Here.
Take that, will ya?

1667
01:21:55,735 --> 01:21:59,364
Uh, these configurations,
uh...

1668
01:22:01,174 --> 01:22:02,607
Well, to be honest,

1669
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:06,076
we--we--we don't know
what the hell this crap is.

1670
01:22:06,179 --> 01:22:08,647
But this is
clearly what they use

1671
01:22:08,748 --> 01:22:11,273
to guide and navigate
their craft.

1672
01:22:11,384 --> 01:22:13,113
Ha ha. Neat, huh?

1673
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,279
That's very good.
Somebody grab my laptop there?

1674
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:18,983
Dr. Isaacs, can I just have
the computer inside there?

1675
01:22:19,092 --> 01:22:21,117
See these patterns here?
They're repeating sequentially,

1676
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:22,991
just like
their countdown signal.

1677
01:22:23,096 --> 01:22:25,326
They're using that frequency
for computer communications.

1678
01:22:25,432 --> 01:22:26,524
Huh?

1679
01:22:26,633 --> 01:22:28,794
See? That's how they're
coordinating their ships.

1680
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:31,632
Huh. Ya know...

1681
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:34,263
you're really starting
to make us look bad.

1682
01:22:41,781 --> 01:22:43,408
They got one!

1683
01:22:43,516 --> 01:22:44,744
They got one alive!

1684
01:22:44,851 --> 01:22:46,011
They got one. Alive.

1685
01:22:46,119 --> 01:22:49,611
Jesus! Look, will you
be OK by yourself, Dave?

1686
01:22:49,723 --> 01:22:51,122
Fine, Dr. Okun.

1687
01:22:51,224 --> 01:22:52,657
Yeah--Uh, don't
touch anything.

1688
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,863
Why is he always telling me
not to touch anything?

1689
01:22:57,964 --> 01:23:00,125
Yeah. There.

1690
01:23:01,468 --> 01:23:03,629
Oh...that's why.

1691
01:23:12,012 --> 01:23:15,209
Right here. We got her
in the back of the pickup.

1692
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:20,878
How you doin', sir.

1693
01:23:20,987 --> 01:23:24,115
Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

1694
01:23:24,224 --> 01:23:25,589
Guess who's comin'
to dinner.

1695
01:23:25,692 --> 01:23:28,456
I need a doctor!

1696
01:23:28,561 --> 01:23:30,426
I need a doctor!

1697
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:33,297
Oh, boy.

1698
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,298
Oh, boy.

1699
01:23:34,401 --> 01:23:35,299
How long has it been
unconscious?

1700
01:23:35,402 --> 01:23:36,300
About three hours.

1701
01:23:36,403 --> 01:23:37,370
Let's get him into
containment, stat.

1702
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:39,370
My son, he's very sick.

1703
01:23:39,472 --> 01:23:40,962
He needs immediate
attention.

1704
01:23:41,074 --> 01:23:41,972
He's drying out.

1705
01:23:42,075 --> 01:23:43,406
I want him sprayed
down with saline.

1706
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:45,637
He has a problem with his
adrenal cortex.

1707
01:23:45,745 --> 01:23:47,144
Please!

1708
01:23:50,216 --> 01:23:52,013
If you don't do something
about it right now,

1709
01:23:52,118 --> 01:23:53,016
my son will die!

1710
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:54,518
OK!Just help him!

1711
01:23:54,621 --> 01:23:57,454
OK. O'Haver, Miller,
you come with us.

1712
01:23:57,557 --> 01:23:59,115
You take us to him,
OK?

1713
01:23:59,225 --> 01:24:00,453
Let's go.

1714
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:04,395
OK. Move it!
Move it! Move it!

1715
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:07,591
As the former head
of the C.I.A.,

1716
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:08,634
you knew about this place.

1717
01:24:10,351 --> 01:24:11,579
When were you planning on
informing the rest of us?

1718
01:24:11,685 --> 01:24:13,380
It had been deemed
classified.

1719
01:24:13,487 --> 01:24:14,886
You should have
told us about this

1720
01:24:14,988 --> 01:24:16,387
when they first arrived.

1721
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:17,889
You should have warned us

1722
01:24:17,991 --> 01:24:19,390
before we launched
a counterattack

1723
01:24:19,493 --> 01:24:22,223
that cost us the lives of
hundreds of American pilots!

1724
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:23,261
There was no way

1725
01:24:23,363 --> 01:24:24,227
we could have known
that our fighters

1726
01:24:24,331 --> 01:24:25,229
would have been
that ineffective

1727
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:26,264
against their attackers.

1728
01:24:26,366 --> 01:24:27,560
Mr. President.

1729
01:24:27,668 --> 01:24:30,000
Commander #2: The little bit
of information that we have

1730
01:24:30,104 --> 01:24:32,334
comes directly into
this room, Mr. President.

1731
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:34,498
Atlanta, Chicago,
and Philadelphia...

1732
01:24:34,608 --> 01:24:35,836
destroyed.

1733
01:24:35,943 --> 01:24:37,501
We've learned that NATO

1734
01:24:37,611 --> 01:24:39,306
and Western Allied
Installations

1735
01:24:39,413 --> 01:24:41,347
were the first
to be taken out.

1736
01:24:41,448 --> 01:24:42,847
Then we were hit.

1737
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:46,113
They knew exactly
where and how to hit us.

1738
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:47,619
Whitmore:
And our forces?

1739
01:24:47,721 --> 01:24:49,621
General Grey:
We're down to 15%.

1740
01:24:49,723 --> 01:24:51,816
If you calculate
the time it takes

1741
01:24:51,925 --> 01:24:53,620
to destroy a city
and move on,

1742
01:24:53,727 --> 01:24:56,127
we're looking at
the worldwide destruction

1743
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:58,391
of every major city...

1744
01:24:58,499 --> 01:25:02,026
in the next 36 hours.

1745
01:25:03,137 --> 01:25:05,367
We're being exterminated.

1746
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:09,534
Mitchell:
Mr. President.

1747
01:25:10,711 --> 01:25:12,611
This is
Captain Steven Hiller.

1748
01:25:12,713 --> 01:25:13,611
Captain.

1749
01:25:13,714 --> 01:25:14,772
Mr. President.

1750
01:25:14,882 --> 01:25:15,780
Well done.

1751
01:25:15,883 --> 01:25:17,714
Where is it now?

1752
01:25:17,818 --> 01:25:19,217
We have it isolated

1753
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:20,718
down in the containment
lab, sir.

1754
01:25:20,821 --> 01:25:22,482
I'd like to go see it.

1755
01:25:28,095 --> 01:25:31,929
General, I'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.

1756
01:25:33,967 --> 01:25:35,798
Hasn't anyone told you?

1757
01:25:38,872 --> 01:25:41,864
El Toro has been
completely destroyed.

1758
01:26:31,425 --> 01:26:33,120
Oh, no.

1759
01:26:34,228 --> 01:26:35,627
We were lucky.

1760
01:26:35,729 --> 01:26:36,718
[Chuckles]

1761
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:39,196
Today was the first time
I used the subway.

1762
01:26:39,299 --> 01:26:41,028
Thank God
for the metro rail.

1763
01:26:41,134 --> 01:26:42,726
These should last us
a while.

1764
01:26:42,836 --> 01:26:44,667
Don't move.
I'll get it for you.

1765
01:26:44,771 --> 01:26:46,398
Stay still.

1766
01:26:48,008 --> 01:26:50,476
He's your son?

1767
01:26:50,577 --> 01:26:52,204
He's my angel.

1768
01:26:52,312 --> 01:26:55,475
Was his father
stationed here?

1769
01:26:55,582 --> 01:26:57,982
Nah, he, uh...

1770
01:26:58,085 --> 01:26:59,985
he wasn't his father.

1771
01:27:00,087 --> 01:27:01,486
But I was kind of hoping

1772
01:27:01,588 --> 01:27:04,148
he wanted the job,
though.

1773
01:27:06,793 --> 01:27:09,353
So what do you do
for a living?

1774
01:27:09,463 --> 01:27:11,522
I'm a dancer.

1775
01:27:11,632 --> 01:27:12,860
Ah.

1776
01:27:12,966 --> 01:27:14,399
Ballet?

1777
01:27:14,501 --> 01:27:15,900
No.

1778
01:27:16,003 --> 01:27:17,231
Exotic.

1779
01:27:18,472 --> 01:27:20,201
Oh.

1780
01:27:20,307 --> 01:27:21,740
Sorry.

01:46:41,934 --> 01:46:43,834
We then upload the virus.

2144
01:46:43,936 --> 01:46:46,336
We then set off
some kind of explosion,

2145
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:47,838
which will disable it,

2146
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:49,339
and that'll disorient
the smaller ships below,

2147
01:46:49,442 --> 01:46:52,343
and that could buy,
I think, at least some time

2148
01:46:52,445 --> 01:46:53,639
to, uh...

2149
01:46:53,746 --> 01:46:55,213
to take 'em--

2150
01:46:55,314 --> 01:46:56,713
take 'em out.

2151
01:46:56,816 --> 01:46:58,044
Take 'em down.

2152

2153
01:46:59,151 --> 01:47:00,049
do your stuff.

2154
01:47:00,152 --> 01:47:01,551
This is ridiculous.

2155
01:47:01,654 --> 01:47:04,054
How long would
their shields be down?

2156
01:47:04,156 --> 01:47:05,316
Uh...

2157
01:47:05,424 --> 01:47:07,949
I don't know.
A matter of minutes.

2158
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:09,960
You want us to
coordinate

2159
01:47:10,062 --> 01:47:11,427
a massive
worldwide counterstrike

2160
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:13,361
with a window
of only a few minutes?

2161
01:47:13,466 --> 01:47:15,934
With the shields down,
that might be possible.

2162
01:47:16,035 --> 01:47:17,093
Oh, please.

2163
01:47:17,203 --> 01:47:18,261
We don't have
the manpower

2164
01:47:18,370 --> 01:47:19,337
or the resources

2165
01:47:19,438 --> 01:47:21,338
to launch that kind
of a campaign.

2166

Not to mention

2167
01:47:22,942 --> 01:47:23,840
that this whole
cockamamie plan

2168
01:47:23,943 --> 01:47:25,774
is dependent
on a machine

2169
01:47:25,878 --> 01:47:27,743
that no one
in this world

2170
01:47:27,847 --> 01:47:28,745
is qualified
to operate.

2171
01:47:28,848 --> 01:47:30,179
I wouldn't say that, sir.

2172
01:47:30,282 --> 01:47:31,806
I've seen these things
in action,

2173
01:47:31,917 --> 01:47:34,112
and I'm well aware of their
maneuvering capabilities.

2174
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:35,710
With your permission,
General,

2175
01:47:35,821 --> 01:47:38,381
I'd like the opportunity
to try.

2176
01:47:38,491 --> 01:47:41,221
That thing
is a wreck.

2178

01:47:45,431 --> 01:47:46,762
if it's capable
of flying.

01:47:46,866 --> 01:47:48,834

the president.

2185
01:48:24,036 --> 01:48:25,264
Let's get this thing
prepped and ready.

2186
01:48:25,371 --> 01:48:26,429
Good luck, pilot.

2187
01:48:26,539 --> 01:48:28,302
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:48:30,376 --> 01:48:32,276
Your idea.

2190
01:48:32,378 --> 01:48:33,902
That's right.

2191
01:48:40,019 --> 01:48:41,418
You really think

2192
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,078
you can
fly that thing?

2193
01:48:43,188 --> 01:48:44,587
You really think

2194
01:48:44,690 --> 01:48:48,091
you can do all that bullshit
you just said?

2195
01:48:53,899 --> 01:48:55,867
Hoo.

2196
01:48:55,968 --> 01:48:57,367

over the death
of your wife,

2198
01:48:58,971 --> 01:49:00,370
but that's no excuse

2199
01:49:00,472 --> 01:49:01,598
for making another
fatal mistake.

2200
01:49:01,707 --> 01:49:03,368
The only mistake
I ever made

2201
01:49:03,475 --> 01:49:05,238
was to appoint a sniveling
little weasel like you

2202

you understand--

01:49:07,846 --> 01:49:10,679
However, that is one mistake
I'm thankful to say

2205
01:49:10,783 --> 01:49:13,183
that I don't have to
live with.

Mr. Nimziki...you're fired.

2208

Let's organize every plane
we can find

2209
01:49:22,061 --> 01:49:24,723
and get us some
goddamn pilots to fly 'em.

2210
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:25,728

but information
is sketchy at best.

with our depleted manpower,

01:51:10,769 --> 01:51:12,168
we're asking that anyone

come forward.

is preferable,

you've piloted before.

the expression,

the firing mechanism,

to be attached to
the ship's main console.

2290
01:52:28,881 --> 01:52:31,179
Just like the Amraam
launch pad on the Stealth.

Except the nuke will not
detonate at impact.

to get your asses

2293

when you've uploaded
the virus.

2300
01:52:47,499 --> 01:52:49,399
30 seconds. Don't you
think that's cutting it

2301
01:52:49,501 --> 01:52:50,559
a little too close?

2302
01:52:50,669 --> 01:52:53,570
Oh, we're gonna be well
on our way back home

2303
01:52:53,672 --> 01:52:55,867

that thing off.

2304

to think quickly,

It's too tight.

01:53:26,638 --> 01:53:28,697
Well,
I had to borrow it.

2321
01:53:28,807 --> 01:53:31,469
Let me see. OK. I guess
that's good enough.

2322
01:53:31,577 --> 01:53:34,444
So, how do I look?

2323
01:53:34,546 --> 01:53:36,741
Oh, thank you.
You're a lot of help.

2324
01:53:39,985 --> 01:53:41,145
You're late.

2325
01:53:41,253 --> 01:53:42,652
Well, you know me.

2326
01:53:42,754 --> 01:53:44,688
I know. You like
to make a big entrance.

2327
01:53:44,790 --> 01:53:46,189
Let me help you.

2328
01:53:46,291 --> 01:53:47,349
Um, listen...

2329
01:53:47,459 --> 01:53:48,824
before we do this,

2330
01:53:48,927 --> 01:53:50,588
I just want to say
I'm sorry.

2331
01:53:50,696 --> 01:53:52,664
Sorry for what,
babe?

2332
01:53:52,764 --> 01:53:55,096
I should have done this
a long time ago.

2333
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:57,259
Do you have the ring?

2334
01:53:57,369 --> 01:53:58,597
Uh, yes, sir.

2335
01:53:58,704 --> 01:54:01,605
Here. Make yourself useful.
[Pat Pat]

2336
01:54:01,707 --> 01:54:02,605
Ow.

2337
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:06,108
Witnesses?

2338
01:54:06,211 --> 01:54:08,202
- Uh...
- Um...

2339
01:54:08,313 --> 01:54:09,940
Sorry.
We got hung up.

2340
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:13,017
Well, let's get this show
on the road.

2341
01:54:13,118 --> 01:54:14,050
Dearly beloved,

2342
01:54:14,152 --> 01:54:16,643
we're gathered here
in the sight of God

2343
01:54:16,755 --> 01:54:19,383
and in the presence
of these witnesses

2344
01:54:19,491 --> 01:54:21,857
to join this man
and this woman

2345
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:23,154
in holy matrimony.

2346
01:54:23,262 --> 01:54:25,287
Any person who can show
good cause

2347
01:54:25,397 --> 01:54:27,388
why these two
should not wed,

2348
01:54:27,499 --> 01:54:31,162
please speak now, or forever
hold your peace.

2349
01:54:33,605 --> 01:54:37,564
Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife,

2350
01:54:37,676 --> 01:54:39,075
to live together with her

2351
01:54:39,177 --> 01:54:40,337
in the holy state
of matrimony?

2352
01:54:40,445 --> 01:54:43,744
Will you love her,
comfort her,

2353
01:54:43,849 --> 01:54:46,010
honor and keep her
in sickness and in health?

2354
01:54:46,118 --> 01:54:49,485
And, forsaking all others,
keep yourself only for her

2355
01:54:49,588 --> 01:54:52,421
as long as you
both shall live?

2356
01:54:52,524 --> 01:54:53,752
I will.

2357
01:54:55,928 --> 01:54:57,225
Whew.

2358
01:55:06,638 --> 01:55:08,196
Good morning.

2359
01:55:11,977 --> 01:55:14,377
They're a little young.

2360
01:55:14,479 --> 01:55:15,912
That they are.

2361
01:55:17,916 --> 01:55:19,679
They look
a little nervous.

2362
01:55:19,785 --> 01:55:21,719
I'm gonna need
all flight crews

2363
01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:24,152
to report to their
designated areas immediately.

2364
01:55:25,257 --> 01:55:27,157
Major, can I borrow that?

2365
01:55:27,259 --> 01:55:28,157
Sir.

2366
01:55:29,661 --> 01:55:30,559
Good morning.

2367
01:55:30,662 --> 01:55:31,959
[Feedback]

2368
01:55:33,365 --> 01:55:34,457
Good morning.

2369
01:55:36,568 --> 01:55:39,036
In less than an hour,
aircraft from here

2370
01:55:39,137 --> 01:55:44,097
will join others
from around the world,

2371
01:55:44,209 --> 01:55:47,610
and you will be launching
the largest aerial battle

2372
01:55:47,713 --> 01:55:49,908
in the history of mankind.

2373
01:55:51,717 --> 01:55:54,618
Mankind. That word
should have new meaning

2374
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:58,087
for all of us today.

2375
01:55:58,190 --> 01:55:59,589
We can't be consumed

2376
01:55:59,691 --> 01:56:03,218
by our petty differences
anymore.

2377
01:56:03,328 --> 01:56:06,229
We will be united
in our common interests.

2378
01:56:06,331 --> 01:56:12,201
Perhaps it's fate that today
is the 4th ofJuly,

2379
01:56:12,304 --> 01:56:16,764
and you will once again be
fighting for our freedom...

2380
01:56:16,875 --> 01:56:20,003
not from tyranny, oppression,
or persecution...

2381
01:56:22,547 --> 01:56:24,174
but from annihilation.

2382
01:56:25,684 --> 01:56:28,175
We are fighting
for our right to live.

2383
01:56:29,888 --> 01:56:31,287
To exist.

2384
01:56:31,390 --> 01:56:35,292
And should we win the day...

2385
01:56:35,394 --> 01:56:38,795
the Fourth ofJuly
will no longer be known

2386
01:56:38,897 --> 01:56:40,956
as an American holiday...

2387
01:56:41,066 --> 01:56:44,092
but as the day when the world
declared in one voice,

2388
01:56:44,202 --> 01:56:47,569
we will not go quietly
into the night!

2389
01:56:47,672 --> 01:56:51,267
We will not vanish
without a fight!

2390
01:56:51,376 --> 01:56:53,401
We're going to live on!

2391
01:56:53,512 --> 01:56:56,481
We're going to survive!

2392
01:56:56,581 --> 01:57:00,881
Today we celebrate
our independence day!

2393
01:57:00,986 --> 01:57:03,511
[Cheering]

2394
01:57:25,677 --> 01:57:26,575
Let's go!

2395
01:57:26,678 --> 01:57:28,578
Mr. President,
right this way, sir.

2396
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:30,580
We got your gear over here.

2397
01:57:30,682 --> 01:57:32,081
I got a jumpsuit for you,

2398
01:57:32,184 --> 01:57:33,651
and the rest of your gear's
squared away in this duffel.

2399
01:57:33,752 --> 01:57:35,549
You got your choice
of helmets.

2400
01:57:38,256 --> 01:57:40,156
Mr. President,
I'd sure like to know

2401
01:57:40,258 --> 01:57:41,418
what you're doing.

2402
01:57:41,526 --> 01:57:43,721
I'm a combat pilot,
Will.

2403
01:57:45,864 --> 01:57:47,991
I belong in the air.

2404
01:57:54,573 --> 01:57:56,973
OK, sir.
Let's get you airborne.

2405
01:57:57,075 --> 01:57:59,339
Right over here.

2406
01:57:59,444 --> 01:58:02,072
You know,
as soon as I get back,

2407
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:04,648
we're gonna light
those fireworks, right?

2408
01:58:10,889 --> 01:58:11,913
Julius: Here.

2409
01:58:13,191 --> 01:58:14,089
Take these.

2410
01:58:16,561 --> 01:58:19,052
Just in case.

2411
01:58:19,164 --> 01:58:20,722
Where's--Where's, um...

2412
01:58:31,810 --> 01:58:33,641
Just in case.

2413
01:58:36,281 --> 01:58:37,908
I'm very proud of you.

2414
01:58:49,694 --> 01:58:51,924
So be careful, OK?

2415
01:58:58,770 --> 01:58:59,794
It's time.

2416
01:59:05,544 --> 01:59:06,670
I love you.

2417
01:59:06,778 --> 01:59:08,473
I love you.

2418
01:59:13,785 --> 01:59:14,911
Oh, damn!

2419
01:59:15,020 --> 01:59:16,544
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait.

2420
01:59:16,655 --> 01:59:17,815
We got to find
some cigars.

2421
01:59:17,923 --> 01:59:19,356
Here! Here!

2422
01:59:19,457 --> 01:59:20,355
Take these.

2423
01:59:20,458 --> 01:59:22,323
My last two.

2424
01:59:22,427 --> 01:59:24,691
You are a lifesaver.

2425
01:59:24,796 --> 01:59:28,061
Almost put a hex
on the whole damn thing.

2426
01:59:54,226 --> 01:59:55,784
Computer: Missile launched.

2427
01:59:55,894 --> 01:59:57,452
Oh, crap!

2428
01:59:57,562 --> 01:59:59,587
What--What did I hit?

2429
02:00:02,133 --> 02:00:04,465
I picked a hell of a day
to quit drinking.

2430
02:00:19,951 --> 02:00:22,579
This is
our victory dance.

2431
02:00:22,687 --> 02:00:24,678
Not until
the fat lady sings.

2432
02:00:24,789 --> 02:00:27,417
Oh! Yes. OK.

2433
02:00:27,525 --> 02:00:28,992
This is important.

2434
02:00:29,094 --> 02:00:30,584
Mm. Fat lady.

2435
02:00:30,695 --> 02:00:31,787
I gotcha.

2436
02:00:32,897 --> 02:00:35,365
Open launch tunnel.

2437
02:00:53,518 --> 02:00:55,008
Shaky, huh?

2438
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:56,021
Is it gonna do this
the whole way?

2439
02:00:56,021 --> 02:00:57,045
Is it gonna do this
the whole way?

2440
02:00:57,155 --> 02:00:58,554
Just make sure

2441
02:00:58,657 --> 02:00:59,715
your seat backs
and tray tables

2442
02:00:59,824 --> 02:01:00,848
are in their upright
and locked position.

2443
02:01:00,959 --> 02:01:02,290
Yeah--Is it?

2444
02:01:06,131 --> 02:01:07,257
Let's rock 'n' roll.

2445
02:01:09,901 --> 02:01:10,993
Oh!

2446
02:01:11,102 --> 02:01:12,865
Aah!

2447
02:01:12,971 --> 02:01:14,029
[Steven Chuckles]

2448
02:01:14,139 --> 02:01:15,333
Oops.

2449
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:16,566
Oops? What does that mean?

2450
02:01:16,675 --> 02:01:17,699
What do you mean--

2451
02:01:17,809 --> 02:01:18,867
Nah. I--I got it.

2452
02:01:18,977 --> 02:01:20,137
Some jerk didn't
put the...

2453
02:01:20,245 --> 02:01:22,076
I know what I mean
when I say it.

2454
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:23,704
What do you mean
saying " oops" there?

2455
02:01:23,815 --> 02:01:26,306
What do you say we try
that one again, huh?

2456
02:01:26,418 --> 02:01:27,316
Yes, yes.

2457
02:01:27,419 --> 02:01:29,080
Yes,
without the " oops."

2458
02:01:29,187 --> 02:01:31,712
There's the...thataway.

2459
02:01:31,823 --> 02:01:32,721
- Oof!
- Ooh...

2460
02:01:32,824 --> 02:01:37,989
- Whaa...Hoo!
- Aah...Oh!

2461
02:01:38,096 --> 02:01:40,189
I have got to get me
one of these!

2462
02:01:49,341 --> 02:01:51,571
No--No. What was that?
Don't do that.

2463
02:01:51,676 --> 02:01:52,904
Just trying to get
a feel for the old girl,

2464
02:01:53,011 --> 02:01:53,909
that's all.

2465
02:01:54,012 --> 02:01:55,673
Oh, no--no, don't.
Leave her alone.

2466
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:57,247
Look! No hands.

2467
02:01:57,349 --> 02:01:58,247
Steve!

2468
02:01:58,350 --> 02:01:59,510
Ha ha ha ha!

2469
02:02:02,220 --> 02:02:03,619
You're all secured, sir.

2470
02:02:03,722 --> 02:02:05,314
Grey, do you read me?

2471
02:02:05,423 --> 02:02:06,822
Roger, Eagle One.

2472
02:02:06,925 --> 02:02:08,825
Your primary target
has shifted course.

2473
02:02:08,927 --> 02:02:10,155
Which way are they headed?

2474
02:02:10,261 --> 02:02:13,753
I think our secret's out.
They're headed straight for us.

2475
02:02:13,865 --> 02:02:16,333
ETA 26 minutes.

2476
02:02:16,434 --> 02:02:19,403
[Groaning]

2477
02:02:19,504 --> 02:02:21,404
Still with me
over there?

2478
02:02:21,506 --> 02:02:23,736
What the hell
was I thinking?

2479
02:02:23,842 --> 02:02:25,810
[Groaning]

2480
02:02:34,386 --> 02:02:37,446
I've been waiting
for this my whole life.

2481
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:50,158
Head straight for it.

2482
02:02:55,140 --> 02:02:56,038
[Whoosh]

2483
02:02:56,141 --> 02:02:57,540
What the hell...

2484
02:02:57,642 --> 02:02:59,405
Don't touch them!
No, no, don't!

2485
02:02:59,511 --> 02:03:01,342
I was counting on this.

2486
02:03:01,446 --> 02:03:03,346
They are bringing us in.

2487
02:03:03,448 --> 02:03:06,975
When the hell was you
gonna tell me?

2488
02:03:07,085 --> 02:03:08,143
Oops.

2489
02:03:08,253 --> 02:03:11,051
We're going
to have to work

2490
02:03:11,156 --> 02:03:12,555
on our communication.

2491
02:03:27,038 --> 02:03:28,437
We have visual.

2492
02:03:28,540 --> 02:03:31,202
Do not engage
until we've confirmed

2493
02:03:31,309 --> 02:03:33,209
the package
has been delivered.

2494
02:03:33,311 --> 02:03:34,300
Roger.

2495
02:03:39,818 --> 02:03:41,217
Major, what happens

2496
02:03:41,319 --> 02:03:42,980
if--if that thing
gets here...

2497
02:03:43,087 --> 02:03:44,987
before the virus
