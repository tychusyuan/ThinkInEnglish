as we've been hearing in the uk an amber

warning of extreme heat has come into

force across most of england and parts

of wales the alert will extend to the

whole of wales and southern scotland

from tomorrow when a red heat warning

meaning there's a risk to life will come

into force in parts of england well

joining us now is rachel ayers senior

operational meteorologist at the met

office in the uk rachel thanks for

joining us um in these hot conditions

how extreme is this

it is pretty extreme it's unprecedented

temperatures uh to see some 40 degrees

forecast for the uk so that's 40 celsius

that's 104 degrees fahrenheit and it's

something that we've not seen before so

it is very extreme it should be taken

very seriously

can you help us understand for those

that don't know watching around the

world what 40 degrees means looks like

feels like because

in the uk today it could hit 32 in

england what will the 8 degree

difference over the next couple of days

mean and feel like

so it's gonna feel quite noticeable

particularly uh the north and west even

the temperatures aren't getting quite as

high the humidity is gonna rise it's

gonna feel quite sticky and then

elsewhere overnight those temperatures

are not gonna be dipping below about 20

to 25 degrees in some places so what

we'd call a tropical night so feeling

very sticky and pleasant for sleeping

during the day across the south and east

it'll be a little drier so it's lower

humidity but still going to be feeling

extremely warm and we'll notice some

impacts on our infrastructure with here

obviously not having widespread air

conditioning units and houses and even

in some public places people are going

to find it quite difficult to cool down

particularly with those overnight

temperatures remaining very high

you touched on it there that no cooling

off period overnight for a couple of

days is that one of the main issues here

with this

exactly that's part of the reason we've

got these extreme heat warnings in place

because there's no respite from the heat

overnight temperatures are still going

to be remaining high we could see a new

highest uk minimum temperature record as

well over the next couple of days and

it's going to be a case of people sort

of closing curtains during the day to

keep the sunlight out and keep

temperatures as cool as possible in the

house and if you've maybe got fans that

might help a little bit but probably not

extreme uh it's gonna help extremely but

sort of sleeping without a duvet or a

lighter duvet and or blankets instead of

a thick duvet is going to help people

overnight yeah it certainly feels like

in parts of the uk we are beyond those

small tips of advice what impact will

these temperatures have on bodies even

in the fit and healthy would you say

so i think um most people will probably

need to

stay hydrated or drink more water

throughout the day you're going to

notice you're going to feel dehydrated

more often especially if you're spending

long periods of time outside or doing

any physical exercise outside as well

and checking on the vulnerable as well

making sure that they're drinking plenty

and staying in the shade at midday so

people just need to make sure they sort

of take their take their take the advice

from our warnings and the nhs as well to

do everything they can to stay cool at

those peak times a day

this warning or these warnings spread

across big built up urban areas london

birmingham leeds big tall buildings

tightly packed together what effect will

those urban areas feel

over the next couple of days so it will

there'll be some sort of what we call an

urban heat island effect so where it

will feel hotter in urban built up areas

just because of some cars as you say

buildings and the concrete and tarmac

around as well it's going to feel a

little hotter there even though maybe

the ambient temperature the air

temperature isn't actually any higher

and so i think trying to stay away from

those sort of areas is going to help if

you possibly can obviously people do

still have to go to work but it's also

noticing that you know people are going

to start flocking to the coastal maybe

areas where i see some water lakes

rivers just being careful of water

safety as well if you're going to go to

around those areas to cool off

a busy couple of days ahead for you
