well joining us now is rachel ayers senior operational meteorologist at the met office in the uk.

rachel thanks for joining us.

um in these hot conditions how extreme is this.

it is pretty extreme, it's unprecedented temperatures. uh, to see some 40 degrees[^degree] forecast[^forecast] for the uk, so that's 40 celsius[^Celsius] that's 104 degrees fahrenheit[^Fahrenheit], and it's something that we've not seen before, so it is very extreme, it should be taken very seriously.
[^degree]: degree /dɪˈɡriː/ plural noun: degrees ; the amount, level, or extent to which something happens or is present.

"the temperature was steady at 65° Fahrenheit" ; noun: Fahrenheit; noun: Fahrenheit scale; plural noun: Fahrenheit scales ; the Fahrenheit scale of temperature.

can you help us understand for those that don't know watching around the world what 40 degrees means looks like feels like because in the uk today it could hit 32 in england what will the 8 degree difference over the next couple of days mean and feel like

so it's gonna feel quite noticeable particularly uh the north and west. even the temperatures aren't getting quite as high, the humidity[^humidity] is gonna rise, it's gonna feel quite sticky[^sticky], and then elsewhere overnight those temperatures are not gonna be dipping below about 20 to 25 degrees. in some places so what we'd call a tropical night, so feeling very sticky, and pleasant[^pleasant] for sleeping during[^during] the day.
[^humidity]: humidity /hjʊˈmɪdɪti/ noun: humidity ; the state or quality of being humid.
[^sticky]: sticky /ˈstɪki/ adjective: sticky; comparative adjective: stickier; superlative adjective: stickiest ; tending or designed to stick to things on contact.

[^during]: during /ˈdjʊərɪŋ/ preposition: during ; throughout the course or duration of (a period of time).

across the south and east, it'll be a little drier, so it's lower humidity but still going to be feeling  extremely warm, and we'll notice some impacts on our infrastructure[^infrastructure] with here obviously not having widespread[^widespread] air conditioning units and houses, and even in some public places people are going to find it quite difficult to cool down, particularly with those overnight temperatures remaining[^remaining] very high.
[^infrastructure]: infrastructure /ˈɪnfrəstrʌktʃə/ noun: infrastructure; plural noun: infrastructures ; the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g. buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.

[^remaining]: remaining /rɪˈmeɪnɪŋ/ adjective: remaining ; still existing, present, or in use; surviving.

you touched on it there that no cooling off period[^period] overnight for a couple of days is that one of the main issues here with this.
[^period]: period /ˈpɪərɪəd/ noun: period; plural noun: periods; noun: menstrual period; plural noun: menstrual periods ; a length or portion of time.

exactly that's part of the reason we've got these extreme heat warnings in place because there's no respite from the heat overnight temperatures are still going to be remaining high we could see a new highest uk minimum temperature record as well over the next couple of days and it's going to be a case of people sort of closing curtains during the day to keep the sunlight out and keep temperatures as cool as possible in the house and if you've maybe got fans that might help a little bit but probably not extreme uh it's gonna help extremely but sort of sleeping without a duvet or a lighter duvet and or blankets instead of a thick duvet is going to help people overnight.

yeah it certainly feels like in parts of the uk we are beyond those small tips of advice what impact will these temperatures have on bodies even in the fit and healthy would you say 

so i think um most people will probably need to stay hydrated or drink more water throughout the day you're going to notice you're going to feel dehydrated

more often especially if you're spending

long periods of time outside or doing

any physical exercise outside as well

and checking on the vulnerable as well

making sure that they're drinking plenty

and staying in the shade at midday so

people just need to make sure they sort

of take their take their take the advice

from our warnings and the nhs as well to

do everything they can to stay cool at

those peak times a day

this warning or these warnings spread

across big built up urban areas london

birmingham leeds big tall buildings

tightly packed together what effect will

those urban areas feel

over the next couple of days so it will

there'll be some sort of what we call an

urban heat island effect so where it

will feel hotter in urban built up areas

just because of some cars as you say

buildings and the concrete and tarmac

around as well it's going to feel a

little hotter there even though maybe

the ambient temperature the air

temperature isn't actually any higher

and so i think trying to stay away from

those sort of areas is going to help if

you possibly can obviously people do

still have to go to work but it's also

noticing that you know people are going

to start flocking to the coastal maybe

areas where i see some water lakes

rivers just being careful of water

safety as well if you're going to go to

around those areas to cool off

a busy couple of days ahead for you
