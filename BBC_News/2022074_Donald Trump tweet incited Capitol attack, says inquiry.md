extremists to create chaos on capitol

hill

donald trump his legal team and outside

advisers are said to have clashed over

the former president's refusal to admit

defeat hours later mr trump urged his

supporters in a tweet to descend on

washington on january the 6th for what

he promised will be a wild rally

that according to one committee member

was a call to arms for some of mr

trump's supporters

at 1 42 a.m on december 19 2020 shortly

after the last participants left the

unhinged meeting trump sent out the

tweet

with his explosive invitation

the panel then heard from this man a

one-time supporter of mr trump who faced

criminal charges over his actions on

january the 6th he said he went to

washington and illegally entered the

capitol building because he thought the

result of the election could be

come to stop the steel rally you know i

felt like i needed to be down here

what could happen at the next u.s

election

as tragic as it is that we saw on

january 6 the potential was so much more

iconic images

of that day with the gallows set up for

mike pence for the vice president of the

united states donald trump has

repeatedly branded the select committee

a political witch hunt this latest

hearing ended with a statement by one of

its leading members the republican liz

cheney who said mr trump had apparently

attempted to contact a witness whose

name has not been made public

she said the committee would take any

effort to influence witness testimony

very seriously but only the department

of justice has the power to prosecute

any individuals suspected of breaking
