inflation everything has gone sky high food i prefer to go to the green markets i will not stop going but the prices have gone through the roof

jake's mascot is a fourth generation farmer even though he has had to raise prices it doesn't mean he's going to make more money 

it's going to be a hard year profits are going to be down what have you had to pay more for every i mean from our containers to our inputs they're in fertilizer plants i think gas and we're a three hour drive just to get here so everything everything we have coming in is all of our products are up

the price increases are hating the pocketbooks of most americans 

everything has gotten expensive food i have two girls they're home now they eat like crazy so i mean everything is like and the best thing about it is that the salary is the same pay you're getting so you just have to really cut corners

so if prices are going up for everyone but no one is making any more profit well that spells danger for the economy as a whole little wonder perhaps that even as they fret about higher inflation many in the u.s are starting to worry that a potential recession could be just around the corner
