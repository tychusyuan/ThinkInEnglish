Hello.
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.
Do you want a chocolate?
l could eat about a million and a half of these.
My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.
You never know what you're gonna get.
Those must be comfortable shoes.
l'll bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing.
l wish l had shoes like that.
My feet hurt.
Mama always said there's an awful lot
you could tell about a person by their shoes:where they're going,where they've been.
l've worn lots of shoes.
l bet if l think about it real hard,l could remember my first pair of shoes.
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

She said they was my magic shoes.
All right, Forrest,you can open your eyes now.
Let's take a little walk around.
How do those feel?
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,as strong as l've ever seen,but his back is as crooked as a politician.
But we're gonna straighten him right up,now, aren't we, Forrest?
Forrest!
Now, when l was a baby,Mama named me after the great CiviI War hero,GeneraI Nathan Bedford Forrest.
She said we was reIated to him in some way.
And what he did was,he started up this club called the Ku KIux KIan. 
They'd all dress up in their robes and their bed sheets and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something. 
They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around. 
And anyway, that's how l got my name, Forrest Gump.
Mama said that the "Forrest" part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that,well, just don't make no sense.
Okay... Get it, get it...
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.
All right...
What are you all staring at?
Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before?
Don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, Forrest.
lf God intended everybody to be the same,he'd have given us all braces on our legs.
Mama always had a way of explaining things so l could understand them.

We lived about a quarter mile{\i0}\N{\i1}off Route 17,{\i0}
about a haIf miIe from{\i0}\N{\i1}the town of Greenbow, Alabama.{\i0}
That's in the county of Greenbow.{\i0}
Our house had been in Mama's famiIy{\i0}\N{\i1}since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa{\i0}
had come across the ocean{\i0}\N{\i1}about 1,000 years ago,{\i0}
something like that.{\i0}
Since it was just me and Mama{\i0}\N{\i1}and we had all these empty rooms,{\i0}
Mama decided to let those rooms out,{\i0}
mostly to people passing through,{\i0}
like from, oh, Mobile,{\i0}\N{\i1}Montgomery, places like that.{\i0}
That's how me and Mama got money.{\i0}
Mama was a real smart lady.{\i0}
Remember what l told you, Forrest.\NYou're no different than anybody else is.
Did you hear what l said, Forrest?
You're the same as everybody else.\NYou are no different.

Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.
Now, his lQ is 75.
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.
She wanted me to have the finest education, so she took me to the Greenbow County CentraI SchooI. 
l met the principal and all. 
l want to show you something, Mrs. Gump.
Now, this is normal.
Forrest is right here.
The state requires a minimum lQ of 80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.
He's gonna have to go to a special school.
Now, he'll be just fine.
What does "normal" mean, anyway?
He might be a bit on the slow side,but my boy Forrest is gonna get the same opportunities as everyone else.
He's not going to some special school to learn how to re-tread tires.
We're talking about five little points here.
There must be something can be done.
We're a progressive school system.
We don't want to see anybody left behind.
ls there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?
He's on vacation.

Well, your mama sure does care about your schooling, son.
You don't say much, do you?
Finally, he had to try. lt looked easy, but, oh, what happened. First, there...
Mama, what's "vacation" mean?
Vacation? 
Where Daddy went.
Vacation's when you go somewhere and you don't ever come back.
Anyway, l guess you could say me and Mama was on our own. 
But we didn't mind. Our house was never empty. 
There was always folks coming and going. 
Supper.
lt's supper, everyone. 
Forrest... 
My, my. That sure looks special.
Sometimes we had so many people staying with us that every room was fiIIed with traveIers. 
You know, folks living out of their suitcases and hat cases and sample cases. 
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest...
One time, a young man was staying with us, and he had him a guitar case. 
Forrest! l told you not to bother this nice young man.
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.
l was just showing him a thing or two on the guitar here.
All right, but your supper's ready if y'all want to eat.
Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, ma'am.
Say, man, show me that crazy little walk you just did there.
Slow it down some.
l liked that guitar. 
lt sounded good. 
l started moving around to the music, swinging my hips. 
This one night, me and Mama was out shopping, and we walked right by Benson's furniture and appliance store, and guess what? 
This is not for children's eyes.
Some years Iater, that handsome young man who they called "The King," well, he'd sung too many songs, had himself a heart attack, or something. 

Must be hard being a king.
You know, it's funny how you remember some things, but some things you can't.
You do your very best now, Forrest. 
l sure will, Mama.
I remember the bus ride on the first day of school very well.
Are you coming along?
Mama said not to be taking rides from strangers.
This is the bus to school.
l'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.
l'm Dorothy Harris.
Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.
This seat's taken.
lt's taken!
You can't sit here.
You know, it's funny what a young man recollects,cause l don't remember being born.
l don't recall what l got for my first Christmas,and l don't know when l went on my first outdoor picnic.
But l do remember the first time l heard the sweetest voice in the wide world.
You can sit here if you want.
l had never seen anything so beautiful in my life.
She was Iike an angeI.
Well, are you gonna sit down, or aren't you?
What's wrong with your legs?
Nothing at all, thank you. My legs are just fine and dandy.
l just sat next to her on that bus and had a conversation all the way to school.
...my back's crooked like a question mark.
These are going to make me...
And next to Mama, no one ever talked to me or asked me questions.
Are you stupid or something?
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."
l'm Jenny. 
l'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.
From that day on, we was always together.
Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.
She taught me how to cIimb.
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.
l showed her how to dangle.
"...a good little monkey and..."
She heIped me Iearn how to read, and l showed her how to swing.
Sometimes we'd just sit out and wait for the stars.
Mama's gonna worry about me. 
Just stay a little longer.
For some reason, Jenny didn't never want to go home.
Okay, Jenny, l'll stay.
She was my most speciaI friend.
My only friend.

Now, my mama always told me that miracles happen every day.
Some people don't think so, but they do.
Hey, dummy!
Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?
"Look, l'm Forrest Gimp." 
Just run away, Forrest.
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!
Get the bikes! 
Hurry up! Let's get him!
Come on! 
Look out, dummy, here we come!
We're gonna get you!
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!
Come back here, you!
Run, Forrest!
Run!
