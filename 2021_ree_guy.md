This is Free City.
Look at this guy. He's one of the sunglasses people.
And the people who wear sunglasses are heroes.
They have a devil-may-care attitude and they run this town.

You are so hot.

Oh, I know.

See? That's not even his car.
Or his wife.
For the sunglasses people,they get to do anything they want.
They go on all sorts of missions.They got cool hair, cool clothes.
I mean, laws aren't really laws to them.They're more like mild suggestions.
Like, I don't think he's gonna return that car.
Or that nice lady.
See what I mean? Hero.

My name is Guy,and I live in paradise.

Good morning, Goldie.

I've lived here in Free City my whole life.
I've got a best friend,I've got a goldfish,and I work at the bank.
What more could a guy want?

Sunday should be warm and sunny
with just a scattering of drive-bys.
Great day for the beach,but not Hitman's Beach,which will be mined and sprayed with high-calibre fire from a renegade gunship stolen by--

And every morning, I start my day with the most delicious coffee in the whole, wide, whole world.

Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.
You know it. Mmm.

Mmm!
That is unexpectedly hot.
Jeez, that's good.
It's like losing my virginity,but in my mouth.
Thank you for making this with such love.

You're welcome.

Officer Johnny!

Have a good one, Guy.

Don't have a good day,have a great day!


Hold the fudge.
You mean to tell me that nobody snapped up those bad boys? Today is the day.

Like every other day.

I'll be back for those.

Oh! So close.

Mmm! This is the greatest cup of coffee of all time.

I wanna write a song about it.

I wanna dance to that song with my body.

I love my life.

There's something about finding your lane and just staying in it.

That's why they call 'em comfort zones, they're so damn comfortable.

Oh, Joe!

Mondays, am I right, Joe?

You said it, Guy.

Yeah.


In Free City, I have everything I need.

Don't have a good day... ...have a great day.

Thank you.

Take care.

Except one thing.

Seem happy.

Oh, come on, don't worry about that, Guy. You gonna find someone.

Oh, it's okay, Bud.

Feel like I've been looking for her forever, you know?
Maybe it's not meant to be.

Everybody down on the ground!

I know the woman I'm looking for.

Oh, let me guess.

Woman with an offbeat sense of humour.

Sense of humour.

An obsession with feel-good diva pop.

Diva pop. Yes, that's her.

She's rented space in my brain and she won't move out.

And you know what?I don't want her to.

Well, guess what?She won't move either in or out.

You know why?'Cause she doesn't exist.

She's just a fantasy. It's a fantasy.
That's cruel. You're cruel.

You're being rotten right now. Rotten.
I'm being real.

Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

So how about it?
Beers on the beach after work?

Of course we're going for beers on the beach after work.

That makes me so happy.

Me too.


What have you got?

Proof of a secret level.That's what you're looking for, right?

You got a video or a screen grab?

Nope. But I know who does.

Wanna know what I do to people who waste my time?

Oh, wow. Ooh, someone wants to play. Hey, you really British, or is that an accent filter? 'Cause maybe we could meet up later.

I don't have a burning desire to see your mum's basement, thanks.

Got jokes, huh? Well, I got a map, shows the location of his stash house. Don't know how you'll get in, but if you do, clip 56 might interest you.Now, I got a question.What's so special about this video clip anyway?

What's special is I kill people who ask questions about it.

Mmm, I see. Fun.Yeah, that's fun.

Damn, girl, you're so feisty.But, seriously, is it loot or is it just the experience?

Those are questions.


Did you see the sneakers on that last robber?

The 2:30?

No, the 4:00.

The three-quarter high-top, gorgeous foam soles.

I could barely feel it when he stepped on my face.

Oh, man.
Wow.

Life in the big city.Ain't nothing like it.

Give it to me!

Looks like rain.

Has anyone seen my cat?

You know something, Guy, people say it all the time, like,"Guy can take a shoe to the face better than anybody I know."
I mean, when you put it on there,you act like it's not a shoe in your face.

Don't have a good day, have a great day.

Love that song.

That's a new one.

Hey!

That's her.

Her who?

That's my dream girl, Buddy.

She exists.

I'm gonna go talk to her.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, man. She's wearing sunglasses.

So?

Whatcha mean "so?"
So, people with sunglasses don't talk to people like us.
You know that!

I gotta try.

Look, Guy! Guy!
Guy! What about beers on the beach?

Excuse me!
Hey!
Hey!


Coming soon... Free City 2!
Bigger! Badder! Radder!
Free City 2: Carnage.
Pre-order today and get the bonus Mayhem Pack.

You done?

Sorry. Are you closing?

Yes.We usually don't put the chairs on the tables, one-small-coffee-over-four-hours girl.You really like that game, huh? My 12-year-old nephew's addicted.Seems like everyone's obsessed with it.

Oh, Free City? Ah. No.I, uh, have a lawsuit against the publisher and the evidence that I need is in the game. So then I had my codes 

Oh,I wish we weren't closing so I could hear more about this.


Good morning, Goldie.

Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

Actually, I think I'd like to try a cappuccino today.
Ooh. "Cappuccino."

I enjoy saying that.
It's like a waterfall made of letters.

Excuse me?

I'd like to try a cappuccino.
Please.

But you get a medium coffee, cream, two sugars.
That's what you get.
That's what everyone gets.
Every day. Always.

Well, I...

Somebody's about to get shot.

Officer Johnny.
I just thought I'd try something different today, you know?
Whatever. Right? Yeah?
Hi.
Ha! I'm just keeping you on your toes.
Coffee, cream, two sugars, please.
I'm joking.
Just keeping you on your toes.
I was kidding.

He was just kidding!

Oh, you think I'd deprive myself of your baristic artistry?
No way, no how.
Mmm. That's hot.
It's like Jesus washed my tongue
but, right before he finished, he finally told my dad,"He's good enough."
Thank you so much.
Officer Johnny!

Have a good one, Guy.

Cappuccino.


Don't have a good day......have a great day, I guess.

Okay. Good day to you.

Everybody down on the ground!

Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

That's the girl.

We've been over this.
You tried to talk to her yesterday,it didn't work.
It will never work.
She's wearing sunglasses.
We don't mess with the sunglasses people.

Maybe I'll get some sunglasses of my own.

What? What are you talking about?
You can't do that.

Oh, my God. What am I doing?
Hi.

What'd you say?

Hi.
I'm gonna need your sunglasses.
Ooh. Ow.
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna need your sunglasses for a sec.

What the hell do you think you're doing?

Go back to your side, man.

He's just an NPC.
Waste that mother--

Okay, just need to borrow them for a sec, okay?

Back off! I said, don't!
Just real quick. Real quick.

Stop!

You broken or somethin'?
I'm the robber!
You're the guy who lies down and takes it!

Please, just stay down!

I said, stay down!

Guy, you don't do this, man.

This isn't you.
You don't do this.

Maybe I do.

What is wrong with this...

stupid mission?

I told you to smoke his ass.

Let go!

I'll give them right back.

I said...

Guy?

He's just resting.

In pieces!
That man is dead!

He's so sleepy.
I'm just gonna put your gun down,right here,for when you wake.
Okay?

Guy.
Guy! Where you goin'?

Excuse me. Do you see this?

Have the quarterly reports on my desk by Friday.

Whoo!

Oh!

Giddy up!

I feel brand new.

Loser.

What is happening?

So much money.


Hey, Mouser, check this out.

What's up, Keys?

What am I looking at?

Okay, so, this user, he gets his glasses stolen and then killed.
The guy was smoked by a non-playable character.

An NPC? That's impossible.

Yeah, exactly.
Nobody can equip an NPC skin on their avatar.

Yeah, so you just boot the trash-ass noob and ban him for life, you're done.

I tried that, but I, I can't trace him.
Whoever it is, they're good.

Hmm. You gotta be better at your job, buddy.

I'm pretty good.

I'll see you on the inside.

Select your skin.

Hey, Keys, what skin are you going with?

The ushe. Dirty stripper cop,big guns, bigger moustache.

Hmm. Little dirt squirrel. I like it.

Almost scared to ask, but what are you going with?

Uh, full body moustache, hot pink.
You should be very afraid.

I'm terrified.

Let's do this.

Seriously, man.


I'm just being honest, I think the bunny suit is just a little much.

Excuse me?

Right.

Rabbit. Okay? My fault.

Hey, 40-year-old virgin!
Get over here!

Let's go!

Uh-huh. Captain Khakis.

Come here. Come on, bud.
Go, let's go.

Closer.
There he is.

Blue shirt guy.

Blue shirt?
Yes.
Hello, Officer.
Rabbit.

Nice skin.

Thank you. That's sweet.

How'd you get it?

Well, uh, mostly genetics,I think. I'm pretty lucky.

I have naturally dewy skin.

Listen up, Neutrogena.

You know you can't go around looking like that. The rules are clear.

And another thing.

You can't hack the NPC avatars.
No, sir!

It screws up the mission load...
Screws it up!

...and it makes the game look bad.

Horrible!
Yeah.

I got, like, 5% of that.

Lose the skin!

I... Lose?

How am I supposed to get rid of my skin?

Take it off, man.

Just take it off.
What are you doing?

What?
Seriously.

The whole thing. The face, the outfit.
How?

Everything. Ditch it.
Take it off.

If you don't, we're gonna kill you.

Why?
And we're gonna keep killing you.

Still why?

Until we do find out who you are,and then we're gonna ban you for life.

Okay. No, no.
Okay, I want to comply.
I just find the order of those threats very confusing.

Somebody's about to get shot.
Light him up!

No.

Come on, Blue Shirt.

Oh! Didn't see that one coming.
Did you see that one coming?
Scared me a little bit.

We're coming for you, Blue Shirt!

Coming to get ya.

We're coming to get ya.

Wait! Wait!
I can explain everything.
I found these glasses and then I can see things now.

Things that-- Whoa, whoa.
Things that aren't there.

Except they are there.

I know that sounds crazy, but it's true!

You can run, Blue Shirt, but you cannot hide.

Come on, Blue Shirt.
You can't escape the rabbit.

We're apex predators.

All we do is bone and brawl and slit throats.

Too high! Too high!

Oh, you wanna play, Blue Shirt?
Watch this.

I tire of these games, Keys. It's time I went god-mode on this beyotch.

Okay, bring it.

Oh, it's brung. Go, go, go, go, go.

I'm so, so good at this.

Time's up, bank teller!

Nope!

I can't die!

I'm never gonna die!

Whoo!


And that was the heartbreaking story of Blue Shirt Guy.

The end.

Doesn't make sense.
What?

I just checked the server stats.

We killed Blue Shirt and the number of players online didn't change.

It's just a glitch, man.

It's not a big deal.

I know, I know.
It just seems like that's something new, you know?

Keys, I know what you're thinking, okay?
You should not talk to Antwan.

I just think it's important to be transparent, okay?

Uh-uh. No.

Antwan is deep in the sequel launch.
He's either not gonna care or he's gonna get pissed and then he's gonna blame us.

So, I don't know what you haven't figured out about the whole situation.

Also, aren't you some kinda MIT genius, indie game designer?

What are you doing down here dealing with complaints?

That, Mouser, is a long and pathetic story involving failed dreams,desperation,
and a mountain of college debt.

You do not wanna hear about that.

You're absolutely right.

That story sounds horrible and boring and full of white privilege.

Don't talk to Antwan.

We never dreamt this would've happened.

I mean, Life Itself, it's essentially a fishbowl game.

People aren't playing it,they're watching it grow.

It's a strictly observational experience where computer generated characters interact and evolve.

I thought we'd be lucky to give it away.

That's what's so charming about Keys,he's clueless about his own genius.

Uh, no, Millie is the genius.

Uh, she built the AI engine from the ground up.

So, to get a little personal, what's the thing that gets you up in the morning?

Medium coffee,cream, two sugars.

What's the other thing?

Oh, yeah.
An insatiable thirst for validation.

She's not kidding.
I'm not.

How about you?

Code.
Code?

Code.
Code, yeah.

There we go.

'Cause it's not just zeros and ones, it's hidden messages.

I like to think of myself, actually,as not a code writer, but an author.

I just use zeros and ones instead of words 'cause words will let you down.

But zeros and ones, never.
Zeros and ones are as cool as shit.

He's not kidding.
I'm not.

Now, I've gotta ask.

There is a lot of chemistry between the two of you.

Has this evolved into more than--
No.

No way. No. It's strictly platonic.
No, no, no. We're friends.

We're like best friends.
Friendship.

And now your game is gonna be released by Soonami,one of the biggest publishers in the world.

<i>- It's crazy, actually.
- It is, yeah.</i>

It does seem a little bit like an unlikely pairing, though.

<i>Yeah,I didn't totally get it either.</i>

<i>But Millie's got a real instinct for these things.</i>

<i>Antwan is a genius.</i>

<i>He's brash and obnoxious,but he's really good at what he does.</i>

<i>It's a chance for our work to be seen by a wider audience.</i>

God, those two were young and dumb.
Jeez.

So we're breaking and entering now?

How does it feel working for a galactic black hole of frozen shit?

You have to leave. I can't talk to you.

Aw, shame will have that effect.

No, Millie. I mean I can't talk to you.

I can't even see you. I'm literally focusing on background objects because looking at your lips move violates my NDA and it could get me fired.

Aw, fired by Antwan,the guy who stole our work?

No, he bought it and then he shelved it.

All right? You're living in the past.
You are stuck. You gotta move on.

How can I move on?

How can you?

Antwan swiped our AI engine to use in his dumb shooter.

Did he, Millie?
Because, honestly, I'm not so sure.

Our game was complex and beautiful and interesting.

And <i>Free City,</i> it may be popular but it's so idiotic, it makes me wanna cry.

Then stop defending him and help me beat his ass.

Millie, I'm--
Come on, Keys, he stole from us.

And now he's lying about it

so he doesn't have to give us the credit and the royalties that we deserve.

Millie--

I found a clue.
It's on a clip in a gamer's stash house.

All I need from you is to get me in there.

Millie, I care about you but you need to leave.


Today is gonna be different, Goldie.

What are we lookin' at?

Who are you?

Okay, okay. Okay.

We ran into each other the other day, you were humming that great song.

Oh, yeah.

I thought you were an NPC.
How did you find me?

I waited outside by the murder train,then I followed you.

Shit!

Can I come with you?

Yes?

Holy hell, what just happened?

What just happened is you almost blew my mission.

No, I mean, how did we get from there to wherever this is?

You mean the portal gun?

Portal gun?
That sounds expensive.

Wow, you are a special kind of noob.

Thank you. You too.

Turn around.

Okay.

Oh.

Is this the North Pole?

Listen, dude.

Guy.
Guy. Whatever.

Props on the NPC outfit,but I'm busy trying to figure out how to steal something.

Maybe I could help you.

I work alone.

You have beautiful grenades.

Besides, if you want to have any chance of making an impact here,you need to have a higher level than that.

That's tough. No.
No.

Higher level?

Good Lord, rook.

See?

Oh.
That's mine.
And that's yours.

Oh. What,is one the best or the worst?

There is literally nothing lower.

Well, how do I get to a higher level?

Really?
Really.

You know, get stuff.
Yeah.

Are you kidding me right now?
Yeah.

Experience, guns...
Yeah.

Put that down.
Uh-huh.

Money. This is Free City.

You could rob a store,carjack someone,punch a pedestrian in the face.
You'll figure it out.

Oh, I'd never hurt innocent people.

Hmm. I've got to admit that is kind of refreshing.

Sometimes I forget not everyone you meet on here is a sociopathic man-child.

Thank you.

Wait. But the world isn't that bad, though, is it?

Oh! Pretty bleak.

If you ever met the dick responsible for this world, you'd agree.

Are we talking about God?
You've met God?
And he's a dick?

His name's Antwan,and, yes, he's an absolute troll.

Trolls exist?

Look, I don't know if anybody does it,but you could rack experience points up by being a good guy.

Like a hero.
Ooh. Easy, tiger.

If you don't wanna shoot people,you could steal their guns.

All that shit makes your level go up.

Go be the good guy.

Okay. No, I'm gonna be the great guy.

Ooh! Ooh.

Okay, well, enjoy your lifetime supply of virginity.

Off you go.

Okay. Wait! How will I know that I've levelled up enough?

Uh, get over 100, then we'll talk.
Whoa.

Bye now.
That's so much more than one.

Like, 99 more.
Bye now.


Okay.

Hi.

Thanks, Guy.

Good morning, Goldie.

Good morning, Goldie.

Good fucking morning, Goldie.

I have three words for you.
Blue Shirt Guy.

BSG is levelling up and at a record pace by playing the hero.
It's got people all over the worldasking, "Just who is this guy?"

I don't know who this guy is,but he's out-skilling all these players.

And here he is,taking out Beefoven, a level 102 from Clan Ragnarok.

This is bullshit.
Who is this guy?

I don't know, but he's good.

Yeah, he's good.
He looks like an NPC but he's running around, levelling up crazy fast by being the freaking good guy.

"This colourful character in the video game Free City

"has been turning heads by being the good guy."

Piper.
Who is Blue Shirt Guy?

You're absolutely right.

Blue Shirt Guy.
Who is he or she indeed?

Whoo-hoo!

There's a worldwide craze that has captured kids' hearts-- Blue Shirt Guy!

Hello, Hinata.

You have a great outfit.

Don't have a good day... Have a GREAT day!

Crazy awesome!!!


Well, well, well. Look who decidedto come to work today, huh?
Look, where have you been?
I've been worried sick about you.
What is this shirt?
Where's your collar at?
Where's the rest of the buttons?
And it's not tucked in.
You look sloppy.
Matter of fact, you look horrible.
Did you pick up some muscles, too?
Or is somebody outside pumping you up?

I'm sorry
that I haven't been around, Bud.
I've been figuring some stuff out.

Whatcha mean, "figure stuff out"?
It is nothing to figure out.
Okay? You go to bed, you wake up,you get some coffee,then you come to work.
And then you repeat the same thing tomorrow.

The girl.
Oh, my God.

I talked to her. I talked to her.

The one with the sunglasses?
The sunglasses, yes!

I talked to one of the sunglass people and now I'm one of the sunglass people.

Me.

Everybody down on the ground!

You're so hot.

What if I could tell you that you could be more?

Your life could be fuller.

That you're free to make your own decisions. Your own choices.

Yo, dumbass.

We are in the middle of something.

Uh...

That's my gun.
Quiet time.

These puppies changed my life.
And they're gonna change yours, too.

Come on now,you know we don't wear sunglasses.

We do now.

Mine now.

Are you kidding me?

Put 'em on.
No.

Life doesn't have to be something that just happens to us. All right?
Just put the glasses on and you're gonna see.
You're gonna see.

Come on.

I can't, okay?
I'm sorry.

I'm keeping these, asshole mouth.
Now get out of here. Go be nicer.
Beat it. Go, go, go.
Don't walk, run.

And you...

Ugh.

Sorry.
...um, you could do so much better than that guy.
You could be with, like, a good guy.

Or maybe
I don't have to be with any guy.

Right? Exactly.
Most of them are awful.

They really are.
Terrible.

Yeah, do whatever you wanna do.

You're my best friend, Buddy.

And you don't have to be scared.

If you change your mind, I'll be around.


Yo, Keys,our Blue Shirt Guy is everywhere.

I know.

Who is this guy?

I'm here.

I really appreciate this, Keys.

Okay. Just to be clear,all I'm doing right now is opening the door.
If this clip really does prove that Antwan reused our code illegally, go find it and get out.
Player's doing the jewellery store mission in midtown.
That gives you 5 minutes.
And go.

Keys, you're a goddamn genius.

Really?
I'm sitting on the toilet right now, stealing user codes,so I don't exactly feel like one.

Oh, you never have.
Good thing I know better.

All right. The clip you're looking for should be on the wall to your left.

Thanks for the assist.

You got it.
I hope it has the proof you're looking for.

Keys! I need your help!

He's got that place booby-trapped with spawn points.
Millie, I can't help you.

Blue Shirt Guy?

It's a Henley. Was that cool?
It felt really cool.
You look really pretty.
Wow, this house is so nice.
What are you doing here?

I was trying to steal a video clip, now we're trying not to die.

Who are you talking to?

You know, that player in the NPC skin.

Millie, there are no other players in that house.

That actually hurt my hand.

Get down!

I'm sorry! Oh, God!

We're doing great.

Wow!

We should definitely go!

Oh, shit!

Is that a Glock in your pocket?
No.

What?
It's two Glocks.

Oh!

I don't suppose this thing can fly.

No.

Jump.

Wow!

Whoa!

Oh, shit.


Good morning, sheeple!

Oh, you are fired.

There is some concern with the bloody zombies. Retailers won't carry the game.

Cut it. It's out.
Never even happened. Next.

It's your lawyers.
They need to get your deposition.

Speak. Which lawsuit are we talking about?
Millie, Millie Rusk?
No sweat.
That will never see the inside of a courtroom because she's got no proof and her ex-partner works for me.
We're golden.

Antwan, hey. You look great.
Uh, I thought you were still at Burning Man.

Oh, does it look like I'm still at Burning Man?
You, you, you--
No. So, shut your stupid, bearded face and listen.
You heard about the asshole running around in the game who looks like an NPC?

Yeah, yeah. We call him Blue Shirt Guy.
But we're gonna get rid of him.

Don't get rid of him. People like him.
It's all over social media. No.
In fact, know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna use the skin in <i>Free City 2.</i>
Oh, art nerds! We're gonna make some upgrades to Blue Shirt, all right?
'Roid him out.
Make him a hitman or something.

Antwan, we're already way behind porting over the skins from <i>Free City 1.</i>

Skins?
Don't even worry about that.

They won't be usable in <i>Free City 2.</i>

Antwan, you told the fans <i>Free City 2</i> is backwards compatible.
It was in the commercial.

You said there'd be the same characters in the sequel.

Well, here's the thing.
When I said that, I was lying.

Listen, Antwan,the game is already buggier than ever.

I got a stack of user complaints,like, a mile high.

Look, I know it sucks.

But the IP recognition is rock hard.
Okay? So don't even worry about it.

I'm just saying,
we could make an original game.

What?

Make an original? Why would I do that when I could make a sequel?

A sequel.

So we can make it better?

IPs and sequels,that is the thing that people want.

Let me ask you a question.
Okay.

You love Kentucky Fried Chicken, right?

Mmm-hmm.
No.

If you love Kentucky Fried Chicken,and I make Kentucky Fried Chicken,and I know that you love Kentucky Fried Chicken,why would I make another restaurant called,uh, I don't know,"Albuquerque Boiled Turkey"?

Okay? Makes no sense, homie.
Mmm-hmm. No sense.

What am I gonna give you? A sequel.

Kentucky Fried Chicken-Chicken,Part Two.

Uh, yum.
Drop the deuce on him.

Come on. Come here. Come here.

I don't want you to stress

that glorious shampoo commercial head of yours about it.

<i>Free City 2</i> is gonna be jumunjious.
That's not a word.
You sure you don't wanna bump up to programming?
I know you got the brains for it.

No thanks. I'm good right where I am.

Love it. Fear of flying.
Can't say I can relate.

But it's all good with me if I don't have to pay you more.

Antwan out.

Who is this guy?
