What have you got?

Proof of a secret level.That's what you're looking for, right?

You got a video or a screen grab?

Nope. But I know who does.

Wanna know what I do to people who waste my time?

Oh, wow. Ooh, someone wants to play. Hey, you really British, or is that an accent filter? 'Cause maybe we could meet up later.

I don't have a burning desire to see your mum's basement, thanks.

Got jokes, huh? Well, I got a map, shows the location of his stash house. Don't know how you'll get in, but if you do, clip 56 might interest you.Now, I got a question.What's so special about this video clip anyway?

What's special is I kill people who ask questions about it.

Mmm, I see. Fun.Yeah, that's fun.

Damn, girl, you're so feisty.But, seriously, is it loot or is it just the experience?

Those are questions.

Did you see the sneakers on that last robber?

The 2:30?

No, the 4:00.

The three-quarter high-top, gorgeous foam soles.

I could barely feel it when he stepped on my face.

- Oh, man.
- Wow.

Life in the big city.
Ain't nothing like it.

Give it to me!

Looks like rain.

Has anyone seen my cat?

You know something, Guy, people say it all the time, like,"Guy can take a shoe to the face better than anybody I know."

I mean, when you put it on there,you act like it's not a shoe in your face.

Don't have a good day, have a great day.

Love that song.

That's a new one.

Hey!

That's her.

Her who?

That's my dream girl, Buddy.

She exists.

- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Wait, man. She's wearing sunglasses.

So?

Whatcha mean "so?"

So, people with sunglasses don't talk to people like us.

- You know that!
- I gotta try.

Look, Guy! Guy!

Guy! What about beers on the beach?

Excuse me!

Hey!

Hey!
