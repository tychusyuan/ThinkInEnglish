What have you got?

Proof of a secret level.That's what you're looking for, right?

You got a video or a screen grab?

Nope. But I know who does.

Wanna know what I do to people who waste my time?

Oh, wow. Ooh, someone wants to play. Hey, you really British, or is that an accent filter? 'Cause maybe we could meet up later.

I don't have a burning desire to see your mum's basement, thanks.

Got jokes, huh? Well, I got a map, shows the location of his stash house. Don't know how you'll get in, but if you do, clip 56 might interest you.Now, I got a question.What's so special about this video clip anyway?

What's special is I kill people who ask questions about it.

Mmm, I see. Fun.Yeah, that's fun.

Damn, girl, you're so feisty.But, seriously, is it loot or is it just the experience?

Those are questions.
