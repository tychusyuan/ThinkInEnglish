This is Free City.
Look at this guy. He's one of the sunglasses people.
And the people who wear sunglasses are heroes.
They have a devil-may-care attitude and they run this town.

You are so hot.

Oh, I know.

See? That's not even his car.
Or his wife.
For the sunglasses people,they get to do anything they want.
They go on all sorts of missions.They got cool hair, cool clothes.
I mean, laws aren't really laws to them.They're more like mild suggestions.
Like, I don't think he's gonna return that car.
Or that nice lady.
See what I mean? Hero.

My name is Guy,and I live in paradise.

Good morning, Goldie.

I've lived here in Free City my whole life.
I've got a best friend,I've got a goldfish,and I work at the bank.
What more could a guy want?

Sunday should be warm and sunny
with just a scattering of drive-bys.
Great day for the beach,but not Hitman's Beach,which will be mined and sprayed with high-calibre fire from a renegade gunship stolen by--

And every morning, I start my day with the most delicious coffee in the whole, wide, whole world.

Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.
You know it. Mmm.

Mmm!
That is unexpectedly hot.
Jeez, that's good.
It's like losing my virginity,but in my mouth.
Thank you for making this with such love.

You're welcome.

Officer Johnny!

Have a good one, Guy.

Don't have a good day,have a great day!


Hold the fudge.
You mean to tell me that nobody snapped up those bad boys? Today is the day.

Like every other day.

I'll be back for those.

Oh! So close.

Mmm! This is the greatest cup of coffee of all time.

I wanna write a song about it.

I wanna dance to that song with my body.

I love my life.

There's something about finding your lane and just staying in it.

That's why they call 'em comfort zones, they're so damn comfortable.

Oh, Joe!

Mondays, am I right, Joe?

You said it, Guy.

Yeah.


In Free City, I have everything I need.

Don't have a good day... ...have a great day.

Thank you.

Take care.

Except one thing.

Seem happy.

Oh, come on, don't worry about that, Guy. You gonna find someone.

Oh, it's okay, Bud.

Feel like I've been looking for her forever, you know?
Maybe it's not meant to be.

Everybody down on the ground!

I know the woman I'm looking for.

Oh, let me guess.

Woman with an offbeat sense of humour.

Sense of humour.

An obsession with feel-good diva pop.

Diva pop. Yes, that's her.

She's rented space in my brain and she won't move out.

And you know what?I don't want her to.

Well, guess what?She won't move either in or out.

You know why?'Cause she doesn't exist.

She's just a fantasy. It's a fantasy.
That's cruel. You're cruel.

You're being rotten right now. Rotten.
I'm being real.

Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

So how about it?
Beers on the beach after work?

Of course we're going for beers on the beach after work.

That makes me so happy.

Me too.


What have you got?

Proof of a secret level.That's what you're looking for, right?

You got a video or a screen grab?

Nope. But I know who does.

Wanna know what I do to people who waste my time?

Oh, wow. Ooh, someone wants to play. Hey, you really British, or is that an accent filter? 'Cause maybe we could meet up later.

I don't have a burning desire to see your mum's basement, thanks.

Got jokes, huh? Well, I got a map, shows the location of his stash house. Don't know how you'll get in, but if you do, clip 56 might interest you.Now, I got a question.What's so special about this video clip anyway?

What's special is I kill people who ask questions about it.

Mmm, I see. Fun.Yeah, that's fun.

Damn, girl, you're so feisty.But, seriously, is it loot or is it just the experience?

Those are questions.


Did you see the sneakers on that last robber?

The 2:30?

No, the 4:00.

The three-quarter high-top, gorgeous foam soles.

I could barely feel it when he stepped on my face.

Oh, man.
Wow.

Life in the big city.Ain't nothing like it.

Give it to me!

Looks like rain.

Has anyone seen my cat?

You know something, Guy, people say it all the time, like,"Guy can take a shoe to the face better than anybody I know."
I mean, when you put it on there,you act like it's not a shoe in your face.

Don't have a good day, have a great day.

Love that song.

That's a new one.

Hey!

That's her.

Her who?

That's my dream girl, Buddy.

She exists.

I'm gonna go talk to her.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, man. She's wearing sunglasses.

So?

Whatcha mean "so?"
So, people with sunglasses don't talk to people like us.
You know that!

I gotta try.

Look, Guy! Guy!
Guy! What about beers on the beach?

Excuse me!
Hey!
Hey!


Coming soon... Free City 2!
Bigger! Badder! Radder!
Free City 2: Carnage.
Pre-order today and get the bonus Mayhem Pack.

You done?

Sorry. Are you closing?

Yes.We usually don't put the chairs on the tables, one-small-coffee-over-four-hours girl.You really like that game, huh? My 12-year-old nephew's addicted.Seems like everyone's obsessed with it.

Oh, Free City? Ah. No.I, uh, have a lawsuit against the publisher and the evidence that I need is in the game. So then I had my codes 

Oh,I wish we weren't closing so I could hear more about this.


Good morning, Goldie.

Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

Actually, I think I'd like to try a cappuccino today.
Ooh. "Cappuccino."

I enjoy saying that.
It's like a waterfall made of letters.

Excuse me?

I'd like to try a cappuccino.
Please.

But you get a medium coffee, cream, two sugars.
That's what you get.
That's what everyone gets.
Every day. Always.

Well, I...

Somebody's about to get shot.

Officer Johnny.
I just thought I'd try something different today, you know?
Whatever. Right? Yeah?
Hi.
Ha! I'm just keeping you on your toes.
Coffee, cream, two sugars, please.
I'm joking.
Just keeping you on your toes.
I was kidding.

He was just kidding!

Oh, you think I'd deprive myself of your baristic artistry?
No way, no how.
Mmm. That's hot.
It's like Jesus washed my tongue
but, right before he finished, he finally told my dad,"He's good enough."
Thank you so much.
Officer Johnny!

Have a good one, Guy.

Cappuccino.


Don't have a good day......have a great day, I guess.

Okay. Good day to you.

Everybody down on the ground!

Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

That's the girl.

We've been over this.
You tried to talk to her yesterday,it didn't work.
It will never work.
She's wearing sunglasses.
We don't mess with the sunglasses people.

Maybe I'll get some sunglasses of my own.

What? What are you talking about?
You can't do that.

Oh, my God. What am I doing?
Hi.

What'd you say?

Hi.
I'm gonna need your sunglasses.
Ooh. Ow.
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna need your sunglasses for a sec.

What the hell do you think you're doing?

Go back to your side, man.

He's just an NPC.
Waste that mother--

Okay, just need to borrow them for a sec, okay?

Back off! I said, don't!
Just real quick. Real quick.

Stop!

You broken or somethin'?
I'm the robber!
You're the guy who lies down and takes it!

Please, just stay down!

I said, stay down!

Guy, you don't do this, man.

This isn't you.
You don't do this.

Maybe I do.

What is wrong with this...

stupid mission?

I told you to smoke his ass.

Let go!

I'll give them right back.

I said...

Guy?

He's just resting.

In pieces!
That man is dead!

He's so sleepy.
I'm just gonna put your gun down,right here,for when you wake.
Okay?

Guy.
Guy! Where you goin'?

Excuse me. Do you see this?

Have the quarterly reports on my desk by Friday.

Whoo!

Oh!

Giddy up!

I feel brand new.

Loser.

What is happening?

So much money.


Hey, Mouser, check this out.

What's up, Keys?

What am I looking at?

Okay, so, this user, he gets his glasses stolen and then killed.
The guy was smoked by a non-playable character.

An NPC? That's impossible.

Yeah, exactly.
Nobody can equip an NPC skin on their avatar.

Yeah, so you just boot the trash-ass noob and ban him for life, you're done.

I tried that, but I, I can't trace him.
Whoever it is, they're good.

Hmm. You gotta be better at your job, buddy.

I'm pretty good.

I'll see you on the inside.

Select your skin.

Hey, Keys, what skin are you going with?

The ushe. Dirty stripper cop,big guns, bigger moustache.

Hmm. Little dirt squirrel. I like it.

Almost scared to ask, but what are you going with?

Uh, full body moustache, hot pink.
You should be very afraid.

I'm terrified.

Let's do this.

Seriously, man.


I'm just being honest, I think the bunny suit is just a little much.

Excuse me?

Right.

Rabbit. Okay? My fault.

Hey, 40-year-old virgin!
Get over here!

Let's go!

Uh-huh. Captain Khakis.

Come here. Come on, bud.
Go, let's go.

Closer.
There he is.

Blue shirt guy.

Blue shirt?
Yes.
Hello, Officer.
Rabbit.

Nice skin.

Thank you. That's sweet.

How'd you get it?

Well, uh, mostly genetics,I think. I'm pretty lucky.

I have naturally dewy skin.

Listen up, Neutrogena.

You know you can't go around looking like that. The rules are clear.

And another thing.

You can't hack the NPC avatars.
No, sir!

It screws up the mission load...
Screws it up!

...and it makes the game look bad.

Horrible!
Yeah.

I got, like, 5% of that.

Lose the skin!

I... Lose?

How am I supposed to get rid of my skin?

Take it off, man.

Just take it off.
What are you doing?

What?
Seriously.

The whole thing. The face, the outfit.
How?

Everything. Ditch it.
Take it off.

If you don't, we're gonna kill you.

Why?
And we're gonna keep killing you.

Still why?

Until we do find out who you are,and then we're gonna ban you for life.

Okay. No, no.
Okay, I want to comply.
I just find the order of those threats very confusing.

Somebody's about to get shot.
Light him up!

No.

Come on, Blue Shirt.

Oh! Didn't see that one coming.
Did you see that one coming?
Scared me a little bit.

We're coming for you, Blue Shirt!

Coming to get ya.

We're coming to get ya.

Wait! Wait!
I can explain everything.
I found these glasses and then I can see things now.

Things that-- Whoa, whoa.
Things that aren't there.

Except they are there.

I know that sounds crazy, but it's true!

You can run, Blue Shirt, but you cannot hide.

Come on, Blue Shirt.
You can't escape the rabbit.

We're apex predators.

All we do is bone and brawl and slit throats.

Too high! Too high!

Oh, you wanna play, Blue Shirt?
Watch this.

I tire of these games, Keys. It's time I went god-mode on this beyotch.

Okay, bring it.

Oh, it's brung. Go, go, go, go, go.

I'm so, so good at this.

Time's up, bank teller!

Nope!

I can't die!

I'm never gonna die!

Whoo!


And that was the heartbreaking story of Blue Shirt Guy.

The end.

Doesn't make sense.
What?

I just checked the server stats.

We killed Blue Shirt and the number of players online didn't change.

It's just a glitch, man.

It's not a big deal.

I know, I know.
It just seems like that's something new, you know?

Keys, I know what you're thinking, okay?
You should not talk to Antwan.

I just think it's important to be transparent, okay?

Uh-uh. No.

Antwan is deep in the sequel launch.
He's either not gonna care or he's gonna get pissed and then he's gonna blame us.

So, I don't know what you haven't figured out about the whole situation.

Also, aren't you some kinda MIT genius, indie game designer?

What are you doing down here dealing with complaints?

That, Mouser, is a long and pathetic story involving failed dreams,desperation,
and a mountain of college debt.

You do not wanna hear about that.

You're absolutely right.

That story sounds horrible and boring and full of white privilege.

Don't talk to Antwan.

We never dreamt this would've happened.

I mean, Life Itself, it's essentially a fishbowl game.

People aren't playing it,they're watching it grow.

It's a strictly observational experience where computer generated characters interact and evolve.

I thought we'd be lucky to give it away.

That's what's so charming about Keys,he's clueless about his own genius.

Uh, no, Millie is the genius.

Uh, she built the AI engine from the ground up.

So, to get a little personal, what's the thing that gets you up in the morning?

Medium coffee,cream, two sugars.

What's the other thing?

Oh, yeah.
An insatiable thirst for validation.

She's not kidding.
I'm not.

How about you?

Code.
Code?

Code.
Code, yeah.

There we go.

'Cause it's not just zeros and ones, it's hidden messages.

I like to think of myself, actually,as not a code writer, but an author.

I just use zeros and ones instead of words 'cause words will let you down.

But zeros and ones, never.
Zeros and ones are as cool as shit.

He's not kidding.
I'm not.

Now, I've gotta ask.

There is a lot of chemistry between the two of you.

Has this evolved into more than--
No.

No way. No. It's strictly platonic.
No, no, no. We're friends.

We're like best friends.
Friendship.

And now your game is gonna be released by Soonami,one of the biggest publishers in the world.

<i>- It's crazy, actually.
- It is, yeah.</i>

It does seem a little bit like an unlikely pairing, though.

<i>Yeah,I didn't totally get it either.</i>

<i>But Millie's got a real instinct for these things.</i>

<i>Antwan is a genius.</i>

<i>He's brash and obnoxious,but he's really good at what he does.</i>

<i>It's a chance for our work to be seen by a wider audience.</i>

God, those two were young and dumb.
Jeez.

So we're breaking and entering now?

How does it feel working for a galactic black hole of frozen shit?

You have to leave. I can't talk to you.

Aw, shame will have that effect.

No, Millie. I mean I can't talk to you.

I can't even see you. I'm literally focusing on background objects because looking at your lips move violates my NDA and it could get me fired.

Aw, fired by Antwan,the guy who stole our work?

No, he bought it and then he shelved it.

All right? You're living in the past.
You are stuck. You gotta move on.

How can I move on?

How can you?

Antwan swiped our AI engine to use in his dumb shooter.

Did he, Millie?
Because, honestly, I'm not so sure.

Our game was complex and beautiful and interesting.

And <i>Free City,</i> it may be popular but it's so idiotic, it makes me wanna cry.

Then stop defending him and help me beat his ass.

Millie, I'm--
Come on, Keys, he stole from us.

And now he's lying about it

so he doesn't have to give us the credit and the royalties that we deserve.

Millie--

I found a clue.
It's on a clip in a gamer's stash house.

All I need from you is to get me in there.

Millie, I care about you but you need to leave.


Today is gonna be different, Goldie.

What are we lookin' at?

Who are you?

Okay, okay. Okay.

We ran into each other the other day, you were humming that great song.

Oh, yeah.

I thought you were an NPC.
How did you find me?

I waited outside by the murder train,then I followed you.

Shit!

Can I come with you?

Yes?

Holy hell, what just happened?

What just happened is you almost blew my mission.

No, I mean, how did we get from there to wherever this is?

You mean the portal gun?

Portal gun?
That sounds expensive.

Wow, you are a special kind of noob.

Thank you. You too.

Turn around.

Okay.

Oh.

Is this the North Pole?

Listen, dude.

Guy.
Guy. Whatever.

Props on the NPC outfit,but I'm busy trying to figure out how to steal something.

Maybe I could help you.

I work alone.

You have beautiful grenades.

Besides, if you want to have any chance of making an impact here,

you need to have a higher level than that.

- That's tough. No.
- No.

Higher level?

Good Lord, rook.

See?

Oh.
That's mine.

And that's yours.

Oh. What,
is one the best or the worst?

There is literally nothing lower.

Well, how do I get to a higher level?

Really?
Really.

You know, get stuff.
Yeah.

Are you kidding me right now?
Yeah.

Experience, guns...
Yeah.

Put that down.
Uh-huh.

Money. This is Free City.

You could rob a store,
carjack someone,

punch a pedestrian in the face.
You'll figure it out.

Oh, I'd never hurt innocent people.

Hmm. I've got to admit that is kind of refreshing.

Sometimes I forget not everyone you meet on here is a sociopathic man-child.

Thank you.

Wait. But the world isn't that bad, though, is it?

Oh! Pretty bleak.

If you ever met the dick responsible for this world, you'd agree.

Are we talking about God?
You've met God?

And he's a dick?

His name's Antwan,and, yes, he's an absolute troll.

Trolls exist?

Look, I don't know if anybody does it,

but you could rack experience points up by being a good guy.

Like a hero.
Ooh. Easy, tiger.

If you don't wanna shoot people,you could steal their guns.

All that shit makes your level go up.

Go be the good guy.

Okay. No, I'm gonna be the great guy.

Ooh! Ooh.

Okay, well, enjoy your lifetime supply of virginity.

Off you go.

Okay. Wait! How will I know that I've levelled up enough?

Uh, get over 100, then we'll talk.
Whoa.

Bye now.
That's so much more than one.

Like, 99 more.
Bye now.
