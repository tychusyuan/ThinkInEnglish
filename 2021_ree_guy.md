This is Free City.
Look at this guy. He's one of the sunglasses people.
And the people who wear sunglasses are heroes.
They have a devil-may-care attitude and they run this town.

You are so hot.

Oh, I know.

See? That's not even his car.
Or his wife.
For the sunglasses people,they get to do anything they want.
They go on all sorts of missions.
They got cool hair, cool clothes.
I mean, laws aren't really laws to them.They're more like mild suggestions.
Like, I don't think he's gonna return that car.
Or that nice lady.
See what I mean? Hero.


What have you got?

Proof of a secret level.That's what you're looking for, right?

You got a video or a screen grab?

Nope. But I know who does.

Wanna know what I do to people who waste my time?

Oh, wow. Ooh, someone wants to play. Hey, you really British, or is that an accent filter? 'Cause maybe we could meet up later.

I don't have a burning desire to see your mum's basement, thanks.

Got jokes, huh? Well, I got a map, shows the location of his stash house. Don't know how you'll get in, but if you do, clip 56 might interest you.Now, I got a question.What's so special about this video clip anyway?

What's special is I kill people who ask questions about it.

Mmm, I see. Fun.Yeah, that's fun.

Damn, girl, you're so feisty.But, seriously, is it loot or is it just the experience?

Those are questions.

Did you see the sneakers on that last robber?

The 2:30?

No, the 4:00.

The three-quarter high-top, gorgeous foam soles.

I could barely feel it when he stepped on my face.

Oh, man.
Wow.

Life in the big city.
Ain't nothing like it.

Give it to me!

Looks like rain.

Has anyone seen my cat?

You know something, Guy, people say it all the time, like,"Guy can take a shoe to the face better than anybody I know."

I mean, when you put it on there,you act like it's not a shoe in your face.

Don't have a good day, have a great day.

Love that song.

That's a new one.

Hey!

That's her.

Her who?

That's my dream girl, Buddy.

She exists.

I'm gonna go talk to her.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Wait, man. She's wearing sunglasses.

So?

Whatcha mean "so?"

So, people with sunglasses don't talk to people like us.

You know that!
I gotta try.

Look, Guy! Guy!

Guy! What about beers on the beach?

Excuse me!

Hey!

Hey!

Coming soon... Free City 2!

Bigger! Badder! Radder!

Free City 2: Carnage.

Pre-order today and get the bonus Mayhem Pack.

You done?

Sorry. Are you closing?

Yes.We usually don't put the chairs on the tables, one-small-coffee-over-four-hours girl.You really like that game, huh? My 12-year-old nephew's addicted.Seems like everyone's obsessed with it.

Oh, Free City? Ah. No.I, uh, have a lawsuit against the publisher and the evidence that I need is in the game. So then I had my codes 

Oh,I wish we weren't closing so I could hear more about this.


Good morning, Goldie.

Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

Actually, I think I'd like to try a cappuccino today.
Ooh. "Cappuccino."

I enjoy saying that.
It's like a waterfall made of letters.

Excuse me?

I'd like to try a cappuccino.
Please.

But you get a medium coffee, cream, two sugars.
That's what you get.
That's what everyone gets.
Every day. Always.

Well, I...

Somebody's about to get shot.

Officer Johnny.
I just thought I'd try something different today, you know?
Whatever. Right? Yeah?
Hi.
Ha! I'm just keeping you on your toes.
Coffee, cream, two sugars, please.
I'm joking.
Just keeping you on your toes.
I was kidding.

He was just kidding!

Oh, you think I'd deprive myself of your baristic artistry?
No way, no how.
Mmm. That's hot.
It's like Jesus washed my tongue
but, right before he finished, he finally told my dad,"He's good enough."
Thank you so much.
Officer Johnny!

Have a good one, Guy.

Cappuccino.


Don't have a good day......have a great day, I guess.

Okay. Good day to you.

Everybody down on the ground!

Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

That's the girl.

We've been over this.
You tried to talk to her yesterday,it didn't work.
It will never work.
She's wearing sunglasses.
We don't mess with the sunglasses people.

Maybe I'll get some sunglasses of my own.

What? What are you talking about?
You can't do that.

Oh, my God. What am I doing?
Hi.

What'd you say?

Hi.
I'm gonna need your sunglasses.
Ooh. Ow.
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna need your sunglasses for a sec.

What the hell do you think you're doing?

Go back to your side, man.

He's just an NPC.
Waste that mother--

Okay, just need to borrow them for a sec, okay?

Back off! I said, don't!
Just real quick. Real quick.

Stop!

You broken or somethin'?
I'm the robber!
You're the guy who lies down and takes it!

Please, just stay down!

I said, stay down!

Guy, you don't do this, man.

This isn't you.
You don't do this.

Maybe I do.

What is wrong with this...

stupid mission?

I told you to smoke his ass.

Let go!

I'll give them right back.

I said...

Guy?

He's just resting.

In pieces!
That man is dead!

He's so sleepy.
I'm just gonna put your gun down,right here,for when you wake.
Okay?

Guy.
Guy! Where you goin'?

Excuse me. Do you see this?

Have the quarterly reports on my desk by Friday.

Whoo!

Oh!

Giddy up!

I feel brand new.

Loser.

What is happening?

So much money.
