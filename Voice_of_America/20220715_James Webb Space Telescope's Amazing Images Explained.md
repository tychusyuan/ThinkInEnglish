we begin this week with jaw-dropping

imagery from the james webb space

telescope what looks like a jeweler's

dream is to date the deepest and

sharpest image of the universe

webb uses

infrared imaging to layer colors by

using filters to create dazzling images

our naked eyes can't see what took its

predecessor the hubble telescope two

days to capture per color webb can do in

two hours

we saw

deeper than hubble has gone in its

entire lifetime on this kind of a

project and so we're we're getting

closer and closer to seeing the first

things that formed after the big bang

now in a few months we're going to go 10

times deeper and then we we might

get very close so stay tuned for future

things

webb blasted off from south america on

christmas day 2021. it sent back test

images on route to its final destination

in space but nothing compared to what we

saw this week that entire image is about

the size of a grain of sand held at

arm's length so what we're looking at is

a tiny tiny tiny patch of the sky

that tiny patch in that image there are

thousands of galaxies and each of those

galaxies is home to tens or even

hundreds of billions of stars and then

there was this image of the carina

nebula you're seeing a region where some

new stars have formed and just off the

top of that image where it kind of looks

like blue sky there's some very hot

stars

whose light is eating into the cloud

that you see is kind of the orangey

stuff below

webb is so good at detecting distant

galaxies that i'm saying that uh

basically

distant galaxies are

photobombing every picture web takes

it's just it's pretty funny

webb also captured this spectrum of a

planet outside of our solar system and

detected the presence of water despite

the planet being far too hot to sustain

human life the discovery and what lies

ahead oz even experts working on web

here we are on this

small rocky world

opening

a medium-sized star in the outskirts of

one galaxy and we've launched a

telescope an observatory that is capable

of looking so far

into the universe and so far back in

time to see some of the youngest

galaxies uh coming into existence and

and spending their youth so really it's

both humbling but also

really quite

exciting thrilling and and makes us

proud um to be able to come together

tens of thousands of people have worked

on it for decades to get to this point

and i'd say

it's been worth the wait

the experts we interviewed give one

bottom line prediction we've barely

scratched the surface of what webb can

teach us about our universe and our

history with much more to come arash
